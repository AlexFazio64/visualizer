He has no idea why she's tagging along, but the pair soon bear witness to an astonishing sight at their destination."},"#Yotsugi_Buddy":{"link":[],"text":"Araragi's in his first year of college, it's now end of first semester, in late June. Like in highschool, his grades and finals scores aren't that great, and he's feeling burnt out and just wants to go on summer break with Senjougahara to Hokkaido.\nHe and Sodachi are in the middle of one of their \"I hate you and I want you to die, Araragi\" periods. Implied to be because Math met/found out Koyomi is connected to Shinobu, and is now spreading rumors about him being a loliphile and badmouthing him in general to everyone.\nHe's approached by an Associate Prof. of several European languages, Iesumi Hagoromo, who's class he's taking to hang out with his best normy bud Meniko. Iesumi is Swiss born and raised, and married a Japanese man for visa citizenship, but she's separated from her husband. They have a 3 year old toddler who lives with her.\nShe calls in RRRG, and he's worried it's about his shitty grades, but out of the blue she says she heard he was a \"specialist in child abuse cases\", (courtesy of Oikura on the warpath) and requests his help in stopping HER from abusing her OWN child. She's oddly detached about the whole thing despite the serious subject matter.\nAraragi spends a while internally narrating and debating about many things, including how many people connected to him have issues with abuse and broken families (Hitagi, Mayoi, Math, Hanekawa, the previous story in YoiMonogatari.), but that his experience with them was years after the abuse, and never with the abusers themselves, so he has a feeling so complicated.\nIn the end he can't immediately condemn her since he doesn't know most of the details, and she seems so weirdly, emotionally distant from the whole thing. And pleasant and cleancut as she is, he can't label her an 'evil villain' or anything. She brings up the concept of \"the abused becoming abusers themselves\". She tells him that she had an awful childhood and she essentially ran away from Europe to Japan to escape her family, and memories. She neither wants to accept that she's an awful person herself, nor that her parents still have a hold over her by causing her to become an abusive mom.\nThe heavy situation further stymies him. Her separated husband can't take the child, she has no nanny/sitter, and her weird mental distancing from the kid presents no solution. And he's worried what will happen if they fully divorce, if she has to leave the country and return to her own abusive family. He even suspects she doesn't care about the kid at all anymore, and just really wants to avoid going back to them.\nBut before he can really arrive at any answers, he finds out that Iesumi left the 3 year old alone at home, locked up, and hasn't gone back in three days to take care of her, so he books it out of there with her apartment keys in hand to save the kid. Obviously he'd do it anyway, but she agrees to fix his grades up in exchange.\nHe finds out that Ononoki Yotsugi has stowed away in the back seat of his car, before filling her in. She got sick and tired of Tsukihi using her as her personal Barbie doll, and fled. They banter for a bit as they're want, before discussing the idea and strict definition of abuse as it pertains to all his harem. She mentions that Nadeko's parents, who can't understand why she's changed so much or why she dropped out of school to write manga, have given her an ultimatum to either go back to school or support herself.\nHe's happy he has someone reliable there to stop him from speeding/panicking, but she gets on his case. Yotsugi demands to know why he didn't just turn the case over to the police, why he's getting involved and in over his head yet again, since locking a toddler up and abandoning them for half a week is clearcut abuse. He tries to mollify her that he was 99% of the way to doing just that, but something is bothering him. Iesumi's bizarre, detached attitude towards her kid, who she says she loved normally, but then implies she 'became unable to love' later. Taken a certain way, he thinks there's a possibility that her own child was replaced by some kind of oddity, or that an oddity is affecting her.\nThey arrive at Iesumi's apartment, a three roomer on the third floor, #333, and enter. The first room is Iesumi's, but the second door is locked and the Prof. didnt provide anything beside the front door key. Ononoki kicks it down and they find the child's room. But strangely, it looks like the room of a baby, a one year old, with a crib and all, not a three year old's. In the corner is a sturdy cage, like you'd keep a dog in at the pound. Inside the cage though isn't a flesh and blood toddler, but a weird doll made with a folded blanket body and a cloth head, with a \"heno heno moheji\" face. The doll has a knife stuck in its back.\nUnable to make the slightest sense out of this, and with terrible theories swirling in his head, he returns to the university to ask follow up questions, only to find that Prof. Iesumi has vanished, leaving her car behind. He waits several days, but she never turns up, so he has no choice but to leave school for summer break.\nThat first day of break he gets emoji laden texts from Higasa Seiu, or Hoshiame (there's some meta 4th wall jokes since Nishioishin has accidentally used both pronunciations for her name). Once only Kanbaru's basketball kouhai, she and Araragi have become closer over the last few months and hung out very regularly, 3 times a week, at his place since they met properly in ShinobuMonogatari (harem: +1). She invites him to go with her to a senpai/kouhai mixer the basketball team's hosting at Naoetsu High, promising to whore him out. I mean, that he'll be popular at her side.\nKoyomi explains this to Tsukihi as he leaves, and she tells him that she and her friends are going hiking in the neighboring mountain trails in search of a rumored corpse found there, as they want to play out Stephen King's \"The Body/Stand By Me\".\nArararagi heads to Suruga's place where they're meeting up for the shindig, when who should cozy up to him but Spooky Ougi, highschool boy edition, poking his nose into our kaii detective's deductions as always. They discuss the case, and the topic turns to multiple-culprit-theory as the alter ego reminds RRRG that he has no proof it was even Iesumi who had anything to do with the weird doll, stabbing or otherwise. After all, they didn't find any keys when the door was locked, so the estranged husband could still have unimpeded access. Also, Koyomi never checked the third and final room. ALSO also, he never fixed the door Yotsugi kicked down.\nSince It Can't Be Helped, Araragi ditches the mixer, heads to Japanese Home Depot, picks up the carpentry crap he needs to fix the door, and heads alone back to casa de Iesumi. Upon arriving though, he discovers an unpleasant surprise: The cage door in the baby room has been smashed out from the inside with enough strength to twist the metal bars. And the creepy doll is gone. Since he saw no other destruction he realizes ... the thing ... is still here.\nSuddenly, like an evil magic carpet from Aladdin, the blanket from the crib comes to life and tightens like a noose around Koyomin's neck. The blanky body of the now oddity-ized doll has separated from the head and taken life of its own. It strangle wrangles him into its cage and twists the bars back into place, trapping him. Its business done, it casually heads over to the front door and leaves.\n\nNot about to be beaten by linenwear, Aragi-san takes off his pants and uses them to lasso the carpentry box he brought for the door, busting open the cage with tools. He runs for his car, but finds the Blanky thing has destroyed all the tires of the cars in the area.\nNow knowing oddities are involved with the family and precious little else, Araragi wants to bring in Gaen for knowledge, but she's been keeping her promise for her circle to leave him alone in college. So he needs to find Ononoki and have HER contact Gaen. Tsukihi tells him that Yotsugi is currently at Nadeko's, so he instructs Tsukihi to text Nadeko telling her that she's gonna run over and play! He knows this will terrify Ononoki into fleeing back into his arms like earlier in the story.\nYotsugi is platinum mad about this scheme (which works perfectly) and promises to kill him when the case is solved. However, once he has a chance to catch her up to speed, she relents. He puts on the thickest winter clothing he can (in summer) to prevent hypothermia, and they stratosphere jump using Unlimited Rulebook to the Iesumi apartment for the 3rd time.\nThe goal this time is to investigate the final room, and see if they can discover anything regarding the elusive husband. Opening the final door, RRRG discovers a bed with yet another creepy doll on it, this time an adult male sized one made of futons. It also has a heno heno moheji face, and also has a knife lodged in it. This time, right through said face.\nOnonoki questions whether or not the husband was even ever real, or the baby, or the marriage for that matter. Knowing that things will go poorly if THIS doll also starts to move, Yotsugi unleashes a new form of Unlimited Rulebook, pinky version, and obliterated it.\nAraragi agrees to keep an eye on the scraps of filling and cloth that used to be the 'daddy doll' while Ononoki checks the other rooms, keeping them in sight to ensure they're truly docile. And then he gets assaulted from behind by the heavy jacket he himself just took off when they arrived. He gets his arm up in time to stop the jacket from fully wrapping around his throat, but the ski cap he'd been wearing zooms over and tries to stuff itself in his mouth, to suffocate him.\nAs he desperately fights to stay conscious, the ski cap in his gullet becomes drenched in his saliva, and its movements weaken. Realizing that water must be this oddity's weakness, Araragi fights over to the bathroom shower and drenches himself. The clothing loses the lifeforce powering it. In the other room, Yotsugi had engaged in a similar battle with a wardrobe full of cloths and the carpet, but had overpowered them on her own.\nOnonoki reasons out that, rather then becoming oddities themselves, it's more like some main oddity has the power to bring life to cloth/fiber/linens etc. and make subordinates. During her scuffle she put a hole in the ceiling, and a small stuffed bear, the sort you'd attach to a keychain, fell down. She assumes it was on the roof, and that it belongs to Iesumi.\nThey unlimited rulebook express their way to THAT park, where Yotsugi states she's going to turn the stuffed teddy into an oddity. \"Yeah, it's all FORBIDDEN and whatnot, and about as dark a grey as you can get without it being pitch black. And sure people get all SCARED when you say something's forbidden, but it's really not all THAT bad when you go and do it, you know?\"\nShe wants a more private, personal location connected to Iesumi, but not the apartment, so they head to the college's parking lot where her car has been all this time. Yotsugi breaks her way into the trunk with the teddy to perform god knows what, and seals the door behind her. Koyomi, for his part, pretends to be the diligent student cleaning his teacher's car whilst on guard duty, when the child's carseat inside catches his interest.\nBefore he can do anything though, Ononoki emerges from the trunk. She has gouged one of her eyes out and made it a core of sorts inside the tiny stuffed bear, which now has a small, simple life under her control. She has the teddy \"return to its former owner\", and they start to follow along behind it as it slowly trundles along.\nAs they tail it, they receive a message from Araragi's code-breaking-loving best bud Hamukai Meniko. When she vanished, Prof. Iesumi left behind an encoded communication, written in the 4 different languages prevalent in her native Switzerland. Meniko's finally broken the code, and in it is laid out Iesumi Hagoromo's absurdly hideous life story for them:\nWritten sometimes in a childish tone, Iesumi explains that her 'Papa' was a pediatrician and her 'Mama' was a designer of children's clothes. And when Hagoromo was born they obsessively, crazily decided they wanted a perfect little adorable eternal baby child who would never grow up. Ever.\nThey locked their newborn in a cage and never let her out. Her whole life. They never \"raised\" her, isolated her from everything, never let her absorb the sort of human experiences baby's get to learn, speech and social patterns and behavior above 1 years old. For fifteen years.\nThe only thing they ever gave her to drink was the basest amount of water, and the only thing she was barely allowed to eat were fruit rinds and skins. For fifteen years. They wanted to ensure little Hagoromo, the \"\"\"baby\"\"\"\" that would never be allowed to grow up, would stay the same body weight as when she was born. Into her teenage years.\nShe barely survived, unnurtured, wasted away , in a dark cage in the corner of a dark room for almost 20 years in a personal hell no one can ever understand. Mentally, she spent a lot of that time still an infant.\nWhen she was entering her middle teenage years her parents had a disagreement on how to proceed. Her mama wanted her to stay the baby in the cage forever, but her father wanted to change her into a \"\"\"child\"\"\" prodigy. So he started interacting with her finally, and taught her Switzerland's 4 languages. When she was 15 and finally able to converse a bit, she started by begging her father to kill her, which she continued endlessly for years.\nFinally, five years later at age 20 he gave in and stabbed his \"\"\"baby\"\"\" in the back with a knife. Mama saw this and went batshit insane (well, more batshit insane), and stabbed Papa in the face with another knife (as reflected in the Iesumi house dolls). Papa died, as you'd expect, and mama ran off as a fugitive, uncaught and presumably dangerous out there somewhere stalking Switzerland. Hagoromo, however, had such a wasted, undeveloped heart and other tissues that the knife didn't cause a fatal wound.\nIesumi was found, rushed to the hospital, and spent several years being nursed \"back\" to health for the first time in her entire extremely malnourished life. She was taken in and raised by work acquaintances of her parents and eventually reached something akin to normalcy, getting the hell out of the country and escaping to Japan as soon as she could since her Mama was still on the loose somewhere.\nShe was never really married, and never had a child, she simply forged/frauded a marriage license to obtain a citizenship visa and constructed a false life for herself. She never went crazy and mistook the dolls for real people, never thought she had a real daughter or husband or anything like that. She simply tried to create a simulacrum of an ordinary japanese life to stave off the horrors that must be her existence. But eventually she just grew to despise and become too tired of everything, couldn't even bring herself to go home anymore and look at how she was living.\nSo, similar to what Math tried back in their younger years, Iesumi set up the entire situation with asking Araragi for help so that she's get caught by him and then his parents (as famous cops) and the entire charade would finally just end. The letter ends there.\nFinally the bear arrives at its destination, Prof. Iesumi's lab near the top of the school. Araragi finds her there, having not eaten or drank anything for a week and in terrible shape. He tries to confirm with her that SHE was the one who stabbed her child-doll with a knife, but Hagoromo is just confused. She questions whether she made a mistake in seeking Koyomi's help. He replied that her mistake was in trying to die.\nThere's a timeskip of about a week in which we learn that Ararararagi went on a trip with his new friends. Instead of Senjougahara as has become custom in Monster Season, it's Hanekawa who shows up to discuss the denouement of the story. She's got long, straight, grey hair for once, and is back from her work clearing mines to work off her debt in chartering the fighter jet back in Ougi Dark.\nShe resolves the final mysteries with RRRG. The teddy bear was most likely attached to the baby doll room keychain, which Iesumi must have chucked onto the roof in an attempt to get rid of it.\nThe reason that the Iesumi Oddity minions were weak to water was because of the severe Refeeding Syndrome that had become Iesumi's life as a result of massive malnutrition over 2 decades. She simply refused to be filled with water anymore after it was basically all she subsided on through her torturous life. \nThe child doll and father doll had heno heno hemoji faces because they were parent and child, so of course they'd look similar. The two dolls stabbed each other's face and back, subconsciously acting out their creator/thrall's trauma.\nIn the end, Araragi postulates the real question: How is it possible for a Human to be \"\"\"raised\"\"\" the way Hagoromo was, in such miserable conditions, with such miserable nutrition, etc. And survive till adulthood? He and Hanekawa both agree to the twist that should have been obvious for a while: She didn't. Not really. Not as Iesumi Hagoromo the Human. At some point in that hideous eternal babyhood in the cage Hagoromo transformed into a Kaii, an Oddity, that at the very least has the power to make cloth/linens/etc into familiars that enact her will.\nBut she herself is completely unaware of this. Has no idea of her powers, or that she's become something completely inhuman and beyond the sphere of understanding. All her power usage, and all the weird shit RRRG and Yotsugi went through was done completely unconsciously, like poltergeist activity, out of her trauma, stress, and mindset.\nGaen gets super pissed that Koyomin (a) had Ononoki perform whatever to turn the bear into a minor oddity and (b) that she lost her eye, and orders Ononoki's surveillance and homestay at his house over and DONE with. \nThe story ends with the original flying carpet blanky that was the baby doll floating into the police hospital where they're keeping Iesumi, with Hanekawa wondering if it's now wrapped snuggly around her."},"#Yotsugi_Shadow":{"link":[],"text":"Nadeko, (who's currently hanging out with Ononoki, now permanently an eye patch character after last arc) is having issues with her folks. Their relationship has grown strained with Nadeko changing so much, and her dropping school to focus on her manga  (And helping Gaen). They're insisting she live on her own now if that's the way she's going to be.\nOnonoki thinks that even if Nadeko clears their conditions and does what they want, they'll just keep unreasonably stacking new demands on her. Their goal, she hypothesized, isn't to have Nadeko 'grow up' or adapt to a new lifestyle, but to drive her to come back to them in tears as their \"little girl\", agreeing to just go on to high school like they want.\nNadeko is pretty much willfully ignoring her, so Ononoki unlimited rulebooks them over to Gaen. Gaen took to Nadeko with hyper tension relationship meter maxed, and calls her \"Sen-chan\", although Nadeko asks her to stop and call her Nadekko, like her other friends.\nGaen takes Nadeko to see an apartment building an acquaintance of hers owns, since Nadeko now needs a place of her own. It looks like a modern art museum. She tells Nadeko that if she can solve an oddity related problem the owner's having, she can arrange for Nadeko to have an apartment at a reasonably affordable rate.\nOne of the apartments has seen three residents in a row hang themselves, or at least been found hung, all from the chandelier. Each of their necks bore scaly bruise patterns as if a serpent had constructed tightly around their throats. Nadeko starts off trying to sketch the \"cursed\" room, expecting to maybe have her autodrawing reveal coiled snakes everywhere or something, but nothing of the sort appears.\nThey then collect info on the victims. The first was the father of a family, discovered by the mother. Second was the girlfriend in a couple that was living together, found by her boyfriend. Finally was the mother of a family, found by her son.\nThe first had lived in the apartment for 3 years before being hanged. The next for only 2 months, and the third victim only 3 weeks. However, moving backwards, the tenant prior to the first victim lived there happily and then moved away, as did the one before him.\nNadeko starts trying to draw herself hanging in the room from the chandelier, but is stopped by Ononoki. So Nadeko draws Ononoki hanging there instead. Still though, no invisible ghost or curse snakes show up in her drawings  like you'd expect to see in spirit photography or whatnot.\nThe owner's upset because now the apartment, and maybe the building are stigmatized  as real estate where multiple deaths have occurred, driving the property and prices down. This sparks realization in Nadeko, who reveals, \"The culprit...is me.\"\nNaturally, she doesn't mean literally her, but someone like her who's looking for cheap residence/properties. Someone is deliberately sending cursed serpents to target and murder the inhabitants of the apartment, similar to the Jagarinawa of her own experience, in order to create a \"haunted\" location.\nThis is a huge lead since that means that the culprit would be someone inquiring as to living there after the 3 murders, to get the cheapest prices, which narrows the suspect pool significantly.\nGaen chimes in that naturally, it wouldn't be the prospective client him or herself that cast the curse. The situation with Nadeko was abnormal, ordinarily one would have a professional do such things. The one who set the murders in motion would be just as much a client to the curser as to the landlord.\nGaen requests Nadeko's help in figuratively, or perhaps literally grasping the serpent by the tail and finding not just the client, but the source of the serpent related deaths and putting a stop to it. Nadeko responds that she'll help if its something she can help with.\nTo start her on her path, Gaen instructs her to not ask her any questions, and just go meet with her old friend who cursed her back in Bakemonogatari.

In 7th grade, she meets Senjougahara Hitagi for the first time. While Kanbaru is practicing with her basket ball team, Senjougahara appears with a group of friends. Senjougahara tries to recruit her to join the track and field team, but Suruga rudely refuses. Senjougahara's friends, (more like fans and followers), are infuriated by Kanbaru's attitude and lack of respect. Senjougahara calms them down, and tells Kanbaru that she will be back later. (Senjougahara in middle school had a very lady-like way of speaking, which is completely different from the way she speaks in high school with Araragi and the others).\nThe next day, Senjougahara comes to Kanbaru's pratice again, alone this time. Still intent on having Kanbaru in her team, Senjougahara challenges Kanbaru to a 100-meter dash. If she wins, then Kanbaru must quit the backetball team and join the track and field team. Kanbaru refuses the challenge, thinking that Senjougahara will have the upper hand.\nSenjougahara returns again the next day. This time, she is wearing the basketball uniform she borrowed from Kanbaru's team captain. She then challenges Kanbaru to a basketball competition. Instead of playing an actual game of basketball, she wants to do a free throw game where the first person to score 10 points wins. Kanbaru finally agrees. Senjougahara wins the game, and Kanbaru is devastated. She doesn't want to join any kind of running competition because she's worried that her Monkey's Paw will activate. However, Senjougahara tells her she's more suited to playing basketball, and leaves.\nAt that moment Kanbaru realizes that Senjougahara wasn't doing all this to recruit her to track and field. When Kanbaru refused Senjougahara the first time with a disrespectful attitude, all of Senjougahara's friends were furious. At that rate, Kanbaru would have become a victim of bullying and harassment from Senjougahara's fans for the rest of her middle school days. In order to prevent this, Senjougahara tried to settle the score herself by challenging Kanbaru to a competition. If Senjougahara can beat Kanbaru in a competition, the matter will be settled, and her fans won't have any reasons to plot revenge against Kanbaru. Realizing this, Kanbaru runs after Senjougahara, and asks her if that was her purpose. Senjougahara replies in a tone that is similar to how she speaks in high school, (no longer lady-like), that even if that was her true intention, Kanbaru shouldn't say anything about it. Otherwise everything Senjougahara did will come to waste. Very grateful for what Senjougahara did for her, Kanbaru kisses Senjougahara's hand, pledging her loyalty."}},{"id":"Anime Monogatari Series Heroine Book 6: Suruga","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Anime_Monogatari_Series_Heroine_Book_6:_Suruga","toc":["#Plot","#Rouka_God"],"Description":"Anime Monogatari Series Heroine Book #6: Suruga (アニメ＜物語＞シリーズヒロイン本　其ノ陸　神原駿河, Anime Monogatari Shirīzu Hiroin Bon Sono Roku Kanbaru Suruga) is the sixth heroine book.

Kaiki is upset that \"Swamp God\" is interfering with his business. (Swamp God refers to Rouka Numachi. \"Numa\" in Numachi means swamp, hence the name Swamp God, or \"Numagami-sama\"). Numachi listens to people's problems, including the problems of people who got tricked by Kaiki. Kaiki thinks she is destroying all of his \"hard work\", so he goes to confront her about this issue. Numachi already knows about Kaiki because a lot of kids have talked to her about him. She thinks Kaiki is an awful person for tricking children. Kaiki responds that what Numachi is doing isn't any different, since she promises to solve their problems without actually doing anything. He tells Numachi to stop interfering with his work. Numachi easily complies, but Kaiki can tell she is lying. He knows that even though what she does is hurting his business, Kaiki's work as a conman is actually benefitting her business. The more people Kaiki tricks, the more people will come to Numachi with their problems. Kaiki threatens to ruin her business, but she easily brushes it off. She then offers to listen to Kaiki's problems. For amusement, Kaiki tells her a fake story he makes up on the spot. He says he used to go out with a girl in high school. One day she found out that he was only after her money, and she vowed to take revenge on him. Now Kaiki is on the run from her, constantly worried about getting stabbed by her.\nAfter listening to this story, Numachi tells him not to worry about that girl, and forget about her. Kaiki believes she must have used that same response to everyone who comes to her. He adds another lie saying that the high school girl literally said she will kill him, so it's not exactly possible to forget about her. Numachi responds by saying that girl probably doesn't even care about him all that much. She may have wanted to kill him before, but as soon as she finds herself a nice guy, that man will easily be able to heal the wounds that Kaiki inflicted. Numachi adds that the girl's wound isn't as deep as Kaiki thinks, so Kaiki doesn't have to worry. Kaiki is impressed by Numachi's advise as it is good enough to trick an adult. He doesn't think that the girl will ever find a nice guy suited to her, not that the girl even exists since he made everything up, (However at this point, it is obvious that Hitagi Senjougahara is the basis of Kaiki's \"girl\" character). In return for Numachi's advise, Kaiki offers to introduce a client to Numachi in the near future. He says this is actually supposed to be his job, but he's not very interested in being a \"collector\" so he wants to give this job to her instead. He claims a day may come when all the misfortunes that Numachi collects will fill up to the top, and a day may come when she will meet an old friend. For those reasons he wants to entrust her with that job, and he tells her to keep those things in mind. Numachi is cautious of him, probably afraid of being tricked. However, he thinks there is no need to trick her, since she is already lying to herself that collecting other's misfortunes can make herself feel better. Kaiki doesn't feel obligated to make her see the truth, but in case that obligation arises in the future, he plans to give Numachi a \"devil\" as a present."}},{"id":"Anime Monogatari Series Heroine Book 7: Fire Sisters","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Anime_Monogatari_Series_Heroine_Book_7:_Fire_Sisters","toc":[{"#Plot":["#Karen_Brushing","#Tsukihi_Brushing"]}],"Description":"Anime Monogatari Series Heroine Book #7: Fire Sisters (アニメ＜物語＞シリーズヒロイン本　其ノ漆　ファイヤーシスターズ, Anime Monogatari Shirīzu Hiroin Bon Sono Shichi Faiyā Shisutāzu) is the seventh heroine book.

Quiet days pass by, oblivious to the fact that he will become involved in a bloody event that would change his life forever. And Koyomi's life will never be able to turn back from it.\nSoon, the first bell rings at Naoetsu Private High School, and Koyomi runs to catch his first class. As he climbs up the spiral staircase that would take him to his classroom, a girl falls down from the sky. He instinctively goes to catch her, and there, he discovers that the girl he has in his arms... weighs close to nothing.\nLater that day, Koyomi meets up with the class representative Tsubasa Hanekawa. He, as the class vice president, joins her in helping the class decide on the upcoming cultural festival theme among other things to handle, although they are supposed to focus on their college entrance exams. In spite of this, Tsubasa thinks that they should do something about it, as a responsible student that is loved by teachers and students alike.\nAraragi soon opens a topic about Hitagi Senjougahara, the girl who he just caught earlier. He knows that Senjougahara is often absent due to a certain illness, and he wonders if she can join the school festival. Tsubasa teases Araragi for being too interested in frail girls like Hitagi, and he denies that fact, although he wonders if he could even count Hitagi's unusual lightness as a sickness.\nHe then asks Hanekawa about Hitagi's personality. Hanekawa expects that Araragi should know better, since he is the one who had shared the same class with Hitagi for three years in a row, compared to her one month. Nonetheless, Hanekawa answers; Senjougahara is a perfect honor student, but she seems to have no friends.\nShe also recalls that Senjougahara was much different in middle school, where she was a lively girl who excelled in sports; Hanekawa also remembers hearing about her being sociable to others before. Senjougahara is also from a wealthy family, whose father is a big shot in a foreign corporation, and their family lived in a mansion; despite this, she does not use her wealth to her advantage. In other words, she is a superwoman, which even the intelligent Tsubasa Hanekawa admires.\nAraragi soon remembers going to a certain Oshino's place. He decides to leave behind the planning to Hanekawa and leaves.\nBefore he could walk away from the door to the classroom, a girl with purple hair asks Araragi about his conversation with Tsubasa, and shoves a cutter in his mouth, with its blade on his left cheek. Hitagi soon warns Araragi about being too nosy, and before he could explain himself, Hitagi shoves a stapler to his other cheek.\nHitagi blames her carelessness to the revelation of her unusual condition (and a misplaced banana peel on the staircase), and admits that she is indeed weightless... more specifically, she weighs only 5 kilos, compared to the over 45 kilos that her current vital statistics should dictate. According to her, her loss of weight happened before she entered high school, when she encountered a crab that took away her weight.\nSoon, Senjougahara wonders what she should do to silence Araragi, and with two dangerous objects in an uncomfortable range from him, Araragi is forced to give in to Hitagi's demand to ignore her presence.\nSenjougahara, cunning as she is, retreats her cutter, and closes up the stapler, driving a piece of stapler wire into his cheek. As Araragi curls up in pain, she tells him that she expects Araragi to follow his promise before walking away.\nBy the time Araragi stands up, Senjougahara's gone, and Araragi takes out the staple wire that Senjougahara left. Soon, Hanekawa comes out of the classroom and unknown to what just happened outside, asks Araragi why he is still in front of the classroom. Koyomi soon indirectly asks Hanekawa if she is involved in the banana that caused his encounter with Senjougahara, and soon runs off to catch up to Hitagi, leaving behind a confused Hanekawa.\nKoyomi and Hitagi soon meet at the stairs, much to the amazement of the latter, and Senjougahara prepares for an offensive, showing all of the school supplies she has on each on her hands. Araragi, however, does not want to fight with her, and instead tells her that he could be able to help her. Senjougahara does not believe him, but when Araragi shows his right cheek, she was dumbfounded.\nWhere there should be a wound from a staple on the cheek was a completely healed wound.\nSoon, Koyomi takes Hitagi by bicycle to the man whom he is supposed to meet, Meme Oshino. According to Koyomi, Meme is the man responsible why he was able to return to normal after becoming a vampire, although some of the traits of a vampire persisted, excluding immortality.\nSenjougahara finds Meme's name as quite cute (\"moe\" in her own words), but Araragi thinks that she is using the term in the wrong way. Disregarding Koyomi's comment, Hitagi considers herself to be a tsundere herself. Araragi thinks that \"tsundra\" is a more appropriate term for her.\nA short bike ride later, Araragi and Senjougahara soon arrive at an abandoned cram school building with a large tree on the top. Before they enter Oshino's place, Araragi requests Hitagi to hand over the school supplies she has; he wanted to protect Meme from being attacked by Senjougahara's school supplies. Senjougahara reluctantly puts away her school supplies, forming two mounds near her, and proceeds to Meme's place with Araragi.\nMeme soon sees Araragi and Senjougahara and welcomes them to his place, noticing that Araragi has brought another girl with him. After an exchange of words between Araragi and Senjougahara, the latter asks about the lonely girl sitting on the other side of the room. Araragi assures her that she is nothing to worry about, and Meme soon reveals the then-nameless girl is now Shinobu Oshino, a girl with her first name based on the phrase \"heart under blade\".\nSoon, Senjougahara goes to the main topic — curing her unusual condition — and Meme's first response is that only Senjougahara can cure herself. Hitagi is quite annoyed at his remark, as she had received the same remark from five people from the past which turned out to be scammers.\nOshino soon demands some descriptions of the story of her encounter with the unusual condition. Senjougahara decides to tell the story herself after Meme assures her of the secrecy of her story.\nAfter listening to Hitagi's story, Meme realizes that she might have encountered a heavy crab, an entity known in folklore in the mountains of Kyushu. Meme explains that depending on the location, the entity's name might change from \"weighty crab\" to \"heavy stone crab\" to \"heavy stone god\", and thus, crabs and gods are connected. Meme also says that entities similar to the heavy stone crab might not be in the form of a crab at all, but it does not matter, since Senjougahara claims that a crab is the culprit.\nHe soon assures Hitagi that the entity that she encountered is not harmful and is passive, and he decides to help out, with Araragi's referral as part of his consideration."},"#New_Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Bakemonogatari Episode 02: Hitagi Crab, Part 2","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Bakemonogatari_Episode_02:_Hitagi_Crab,_Part_2","toc":["#Summary","#Synopsis",{"#Characters":["#New_Characters"]},"#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Referbacks","#Cultural_References","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Hitagi Crab, Part 2\" (ひたぎクラブ　其の弐, Hitagi Kurabu, Sono Ni) is the second episode of the Bakemonogatari anime series, first broadcast on July 10, 2009.

While she prepares to change into a comfortable attire for Meme's ceremony, Araragi realizes that the mansion the Senjougahara family owned was long gone, and Hitagi has been living in a patched-up apartment unit for some time.\nKoyomi then recalls the reason why he was in Hitagi's house in the first place: Meme asked Hitagi to take a bath in cold water and change into clean clothes, returning to Meme's place at midnight. Koyomi also remembers the price Hitagi has to pay in return for Meme's services: 100,000 yen, which is quite small compared to the 5,000,000 yen Meme demanded from him.\n\nSenjougahara soon steps out of the bathroom completely naked to Araragi's surprise. An embarrassed Araragi turns around and constantly avoids catching a glimpse of Hitagi's naked body, scolding her in the process. However, Hitagi stubbornly disobeys his requests for her to get dressed immediately and walks around in her underwear. And to make things worse for Araragi, he discovers that Hitagi might be deliberately teasing him using her own body and using that against him.\nAraragi soon endures an awkward conversation with Hitagi, who appears to be taking her time changing her clothes on purpose. However, it seems that Hitagi is really uncomfortable when changing clothes, since they feel heavy to her.\nHitagi eventually decides on an attire for the midnight visit to Meme's house, and before they head to Meme's place, she invites Araragi to come with her to Hokkaido, where there are delicious crab.\n\nA short bike ride after, they arrive at Meme's place, where the owner of the house welcomes them dressed in the white robes of a Shinto priest, although he later clarifies that he is not a professional priest. Meme then takes them to one of the many rooms that take up Meme's unusual house.\nOn the way, Araragi wonders about Meme's approach to Senjougahara's problem, and Meme clarifies that since gods are involved in Hitagi's loss of weight, they should confront them by prayer, not by violence. Meme, however, expects that the god that affected Senjougahara might not listen to their request.\nThey later proceed to the third floor of the derelict building-turned temporary shelter.\nSenjougahara, Araragi and Meme arrive at a room filled with shimenawa rope, candles and shide. As Meme stand in front of an altar, he asks the two to lower their heads. Then, as Araragi watches, Meme asks Senjougahara to relax herself, first by offering her a small cup of sake, then by using a form of hypnosis, slowly asks his way into knowing more about Hitagi's past.\nAccording to Hitagi, her family was a victim of a cult who was able to deceive her mother into investing the entire family's fortune into that cult. In addition to that, one of the cult's high-ranking leaders attempted to sexually assault her in her middle school years. Fortunately, she managed to defend herself, but at the cost of her mother being punished by the cult.\nMeme soon asks Hitagi to open her eyes, and there, she sees the image of a crab with shining yellow eyes and a body composing of numerous characters of the word \"crab\" (蟹) floating around, a sight that only she could see. Before Senjougahara could plead to the crab-shaped god, she flew into the wall behind her, attacked by the crab that had taken her weight and memories of the past.\n\nMeme decides to drastic measures, so he performs a judo throw on the crab that's pinning Hitagi into the wall. There, he considers taking care of the crab in a more violent manner, but Hitagi, struggling to stand up after the close encounter with the heavy stone crab, pleads to Meme to give her another chance.\nAs Meme holds on to the crab, Hitagi prepares herself as she bows low at the god who took her weight and her memories. Hitagi's sincere request soon paid off, as the crab beneath Meme vanishes.\n\nIt turns out that Hitagi's mother started attending a certain cult when she was in the fifth grade of elementary. At that time, Hitagi was diagnosed with a grave medical condition, and as Hitagi was prepared into the operating room, her mother slowly became attached to the cult. Fortunately, Hitagi made it through the operation, and there was no turning back for her mother.\nHitagi's relationship with her mother deteriorated to the point that they no longer talk to each other. Then, the event that almost destroyed Hitagi's life happened, and the Senjougahara family became a ticking time bomb that eventually exploded.\nAfter Hitagi and her father moved elsewhere, she met the crab that brought her to where she is right now.\n\nAs Hitagi tearfully releases her feelings, Meme explains that Hitagi has deliberately taken herself into this situation, and now that she has finally accepted the truth, there is nothing to do but to keep it in her heart. However, it does not mean that there is still a chance that Senjougahara's family would return to normal.\nIt seems that Hitagi is already prepared for everything.\nShe finally stands up after regaining her normal weight and memories back, and she now considers Araragi as her friend, much to his surprise.\n\nThe next day, Koyomi is awakened by his siblings Karen and Tsukihi. He feels heavy and feverish, and has probably gotten only a few hours of sleep. Out of curiosity, he tries weighing himself on the bathroom scale, only to realize the fickleness of a god's mind."},"#New_Characters":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Bakemonogatari Episode 03: Mayoi Snail, Part 1","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Bakemonogatari_Episode_03:_Mayoi_Snail,_Part_1","toc":["#Synopsis",{"#Characters":["#New_Characters"]},"#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Mayoi Snail, Part 1\" (まよいマイマイ　其の壱, Mayoi Maimai, Sono Ichi) is the third episode of the Bakemonogatari anime series.

Hitagi suspects that Araragi is having dirty thoughts of her in her dress, but he tries to clear himself of those suspicions. She then proceeds to tell Koyomi that she just bought the dress recently, and if possible, wants him to be the first to see her wear it for the first time; Araragi feels somewhat honored, but Hitagi points out that her intentions were different than what he thought.\nThe topic soon returns to why Araragi is alone at the park at that time of day. Araragi leaves out the real reason, and tells Hitagi that he was touring, and ends up at the park by chance. Hitagi then notes that she was quite familiar of the park, which she had visited a long time ago, until \"certain things changed\".\nSenjougahara then decides to sit beside Araragi, and in an instant, he feels like his heart jumped when Hitagi went too close. Hitagi then expresses her determination to return the offer that Araragi did to cure her of her oddity, and he thinks that her declaration is slowly becoming that of love, not mere responsibility.\nThen, with Hitagi just inches from Araragi's face, she tells that after she had paid back Araragi, the two would be friends on equal footing. Friends. That word somehow disappoints Koyomi.\nWith that said, Hitagi asks Koyomi about what she needs to do to repay his favor... whether it is saving the world or putting herself in the shoes of an eroge's female main character. Hitagi suggests that she should wear nothing but an apron and cook breakfast for him, but Koyomi points out that doing so would compromise how he would see Hitagi, so he refuses. Hitagi understands that, but thinks that it is because he is a virgin that he does not want any sexual favors.\nHowever, she points out that she accepts Araragi for being a virgin because she is a virgin herself.\nSenjougahara soon changes the topic and asks Koyomi whether something is currently troubling him. He decides that it is the perfect time to tell about his experiences earlier, and recalls his argument with his little sister. According to him, he felt like his own home wasn't his on Mother's Day, particularly because of his two younger sisters who are attached to their mother. It was the real reason why he left the house, and it caused the argument between him and his younger sister Karen. It also left Koyomi with a desire to not go home.\nHitagi admits that she cannot do anything regarding his complex issue with his family and she does not like to sugarcoat his situation, either. However, she points out that Araragi needs to make up with his sisters no matter what. Also, she declares that she would not leave his side despite his clear lack of self-esteem.\nWith that settled, Hitagi asks for any other problems that Koyomi needs help with, but Araragi refuses to say anything, thinking that he would find himself in more verbal abuse from her. Senjougahara then suggests helping him study, but Koyomi also rejected the offer as he is content in graduating, but she remains determined to help him in any way.\nThen, Hitagi shocks Araragi by offering something else: herself, as his girlfriend.\nKoyomi refuses to that offer as well.\nA moment of silence separates the two until Araragi notices a little girl at a distance.\nAraragi uses his improved sight to look at the girl's nametag and it was written using the characters for \"eight\", \"nine\" and \"temple\". He asks help to Senjougahara to determine how it was read, and although Hitagi was not able to see the characters correctly, she was able to understand the characters with Araragi's help; it reads as \"Hachikuji\", and the little girl's name is Mayoi Hachikuji.\nInterested to make friends with the girl, Araragi decides to approach her and asks if she needed help. However, the rude grade-schooler always shoots down his attempts on making friends. Koyomi eventually loses his patience and uses his own way of getting attention: hitting the girl at the back of her head and trying to act nice and apologetic afterwards. It worked initially, but when Mayoi suddenly kicked him in the gut, Koyomi loses his composure and a fight between a grade-schooler and a high school student ended with an unconscious girl after receiving a judo throw from Araragi.\nKoyomi is the victor in the struggle, but he feels that he won a stupid fight. What's worse is that Senjougahara is disgusted to even touch him. Regardless, he takes the time to ask Senjougahara about the address Mayoi is looking for.\nAs Hitagi leads the way to Mayoi's destination, Araragi urges Mayoi to follow her.\nAt that moment, Mayoi calls herself a lost child... moreover, a lost snail."},"#New_Characters":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Bakemonogatari Episode 04: Mayoi Snail, Part 2","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Bakemonogatari_Episode_04:_Mayoi_Snail,_Part_2","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Mayoi Snail, Part 2\" (まよいマイマイ　其の弐, Mayoi Maimai, Sono Ni) is the fourth episode of the Bakemonogatari anime series.

It's gotta be a 'lost cow'.\"\nMeme explains through Araragi's phone the oddity they are currently facing. According to him, there are lot of oddities that lead its victims astray, and a \"lost cow\" is distinct because it is also called a \"lost snail.\"\nAfter calling Meme, Araragi and Senjougahara go on their way... of course, with Mayoi tailing behind Araragi.\nA short walk afterwards, Senjougahara stops and tells that where she stood is where her house was a long time ago before it was sold. However, there is now a stretch of road occupying that space. Senjougahara puts the blame to urban renewal, but even she is amazed at how much one year has changed a lot in her old neighborhood. She soon decides to continue on their search for Hachikuji's address.\nKoyomi finds it difficult to walk with Mayoi clinging to him too much and tells her to back off a little. However, Mayoi becomes too defensive, and even plans to tell the PTA on him. Araragi wonders what PTA stands for, and Hitagi suddenly responds; it stands for \"parent-teacher association\", but can also stand for \"percutaneous transluminal angioplasty\". After Araragi gets called incapable for not knowing such information, they head off again.\nAraragi soon wonders what awaits them on the address they are heading to. Mayoi continues to reject Araragi's request to tell about it, but a 10,000-yen bill manages to persuade her instantly. Mayoi tells to Koyomi that there is someone named Tsunade where they are heading. Soon, their conversation shifts to what one should be doing on Mother's Day to a sloppy pun on \"touring\". Meanwhile, Senjougahara continues to walk forward.\nThe conversation of the two soon talks about Mayoi stuttering, and ending up saying \"Arararagi-san\". Araragi tells her that he doesn't make the same mistake in names like she does, and Mayoi challenges him to say a tongue twister. Well, he did speak the tongue twister correctly, but Mayoi once again tries to be witty.\nHitagi soon asks Araragi to give the address to Mayoi's destination once again. Upon listening to the address, Senjougahara realizes that they might have gone too far, so they head back to retrace their steps.\nOn the way back, Araragi notices that Mayoi appears to be afraid of Hitagi. Mayoi tells him that she feels that Senjougahara hates her, and wants her dead. Araragi's question to Hitagi soon confirms it straight from her mouth, but Hitagi also points out that she only has difficulty in interacting with them, thus the hate.\nSoon, Hitagi asks Araragi for the address once again since she thinks that they have gone far off again. Araragi is shocked to find out that they have gone off-course twice, and he thinks that urban renewal is to blame for all of this. As a last resort, Senjougahara decides to use the GPS on her phone to determine their location.\nHowever, it suddenly went out of range.\nAs the two become puzzled as to what is going on, Mayoi appears to be losing hope to getting to the address, which turns out to be where her mother lives.\nUnable to reach their destination, Araragi, Hitagi and Mayoi go back to Namishiro Park. Hitagi, using Araragi's bike, heads to Meme's place to personally ask about the oddity they encountered, while Araragi join Mayoi at the park.\nAraragi takes the time to know more about Mayoi, and with some bribes, Mayoi manages to talk about her mother. According to her, the \"Tsunade\" she mentioned earlier is the surname of her mother — and hers, until third grade, when she changed it to Hachikuji. Mayoi discovers that although she can go to her mother's house any time, she always fails to find her mother's house.\nThen, as Araragi reaches his hand towards Mayoi, the elementary school girl snaps at him, biting his fingers and refusing to let go of them. Because of this, Araragi is forced to hit her so hard that she blacks out. Of course, this is yet another hollow victory for Araragi, who had been victorious against an elementary school girl twice.\nSoon, Araragi is greeted by none other than Hanekawa, who just passed by. According to her, she is also killing time like Araragi, and is doing her routine walks on Sunday as she is not comfortable staying at her house. Tsubasa soon notices Mayoi and asks about her. Upon finding out what Mayoi's surname is, Hanekawa appears to be familiar with the surname Hachikuji, although she finds out that she might be mistaking it for a similar-sounding surname.\nTsubasa then talks to Mayoi when she finally comes to. Initially, Mayoi is unfriendly towards her, but Hanekawa easily manages to tame her, although she both scolds the two for hurting each other.\nHanekawa, after finding out that Mayoi is a lost girl, tries to help out with her problem. Araragi turns her down, telling Hanekawa that Senjougahara is already on her way to get help. Of course, this gives Tsubasa ideas of the two getting together, so she decides to take her leave. Before letting her go, however, Araragi decides to ask her about someone named Tsunade living in the area. For the first time, Hanekawa tells him that she doesn't know anyone by that name. After a quick apology, Hanekawa leaves for good.\nAfterwards, he receives a call from Hitagi's number. A disgruntled Meme finds his quality slacking time interrupted by Hitagi, and he also notes how much Araragi has been involved with oddities lately. Araragi soon tells Meme that a girl named Mayoi Hachikuji is the one who has met the oddity, and in response, Meme scolds Araragi for putting himself in things without thinking about the risks. Meme plans to refuse his request, but Senjougahara's quick threat manages to change his mind.\nMeme, admitting that he is not comfortable with sending messages via phone, decides to relay the message to him through Hitagi, so meanwhile, he has to wait for her return at Namishiro Park. For the meantime, Araragi will have to enjoy Mayoi's company for a longer time."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Bakemonogatari Episode 05: Mayoi Snail, Part 3","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Bakemonogatari_Episode_05:_Mayoi_Snail,_Part_3","toc":["#Synopsis","#New_Characters","#Music","#Trivia","#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Mayoi Snail, Part 3\" (まよいマイマイ 其ノ參, Mayoi Maimai, Sono San) is the fifth episode of the Bakemonogatari anime series.

Their mission: to visit an abandoned shrine at the top of the mountain and place an ofuda on its altar. Kanbaru thinks that Meme himself should have done the task himself, but Araragi decides to do it as part of repaying Meme's assistance for turning him back to normal.\nSoon, Kanbaru is asked by Koyomi about whatever Senjougahara might have told Kanbaru. To Araragi's shock, Kanbaru was asked by Senjougahara to tell her if he was to give her any trouble, and Hitagi even gave Kanbaru the choice as to which punishment would be much worse for him.\nThe topic soon shifts to Senjougahara's upcoming birthday of the 7th of July. Araragi thinks of organizing a small birthday party and inviting Hitagi's friends to come along, but Kanbaru thinks that Hitagi would prefer spending her birthday alone with Araragi.\nAraragi later asks about Kanbaru's left arm, which still resembles a monkey's left paw. Kanbaru tells him that Meme assures her about the condition of her arm, telling her that it would completely heal when she turns twenty. Araragi is quite relieved to hear the good news, and Kanbaru just smiles in response.\n\nThe two soon reach the some stretch, and they stumble upon the shambled ruins of an old shrine. As Araragi pulls out the ofuda from his jacket, Kanbaru starts to lose her balance all of a sudden. Araragi is worried about her, but she assures that she is fine, as long as she could find a place to rest and eat their lunch. He follows Suruga's remark and goes to the shrine's altar to finish his task immediately.\nOn his way, he remembers the girl he saw go down the mountainside on their way, and wonders if he had met the girl before. For some reason, he thinks that his little sisters were the reason why she knows the girl. Araragi soon steps into the temple entrance and sticks the ofuda on the temple door.\nWith the task complete, he now has to go back to see Kanbaru. However, she's nowhere around the same spot where he and Kanbaru parted ways. He manages to find Kanbaru, and she was standing in front of an old tree with shimenawa rope tied around it.\nKoyomi thought that Kanbaru needed a rest and offers a spot in the temple ruins so that she could rest. However, Kanbaru focuses on the stains of blood on the tree in front of them, and the poor creatures that are impaled onto the tree — white snakes.\nAt that moment, Koyomi concluded that the girl they met on their ascent to the temple is none other than Nadeko Sengoku.\n\nThe day after that, Koyomi meets up with Tsubasa and they head to a bookstore to purchase some reference books. Tsubasa is quite surprised that she was consulted by Araragi about picking the right books, and soon, she and Koyomi talk about his plans for the future. (Of course, Hanekawa \"predicted\" that Senjougahara is going to a university, and Araragi is trying to get a recommendation so that he can get to the same university.)\nHanekawa soon opens the topic about the ruined shrine he talked about yesterday. According to Koyomi, he and Kanbaru took the time to bury the snake corpses, only to realize that the shrine is littered with snake corpses. Tsubasa explains that the shrine, called Kita-Shirahebi Shrine, is probably created to worship a snake god, but she admits that she doesn't know more about the shrine.\nShe then shifts the topic to Kanbaru, who she thinks \"has it hard\".\nAraragi thought that Hanekawa is referring to her sickness when they climbed the mountain, but Tsubasa points out that she is talking about her situation as his girlfriend's junior. He admits that being close to Kanbaru is requested by Senjougahara herself, and he is somewhat helpless about it.\n\nAnd Hanekawa seems to be quite alarmed at Araragi's instinct of helping everyone.\nAfter pointing out what she means, she scolds Araragi and explains that Senjougahara wants him to be close to Kanbaru, but only while he is able to draw a clear line between friendship and beyond. Hanekawa tells him that he should learn to truly cherish a person by trying to control himself and his decisions. Araragi thanks her for a valuable piece of advice and they soon head to the cashier downstairs.\nOn their way, Araragi discovers that Tsubasa does not plan on going to college; she actually wants to go on a trip around the world and learn new things. Of course, she doesn't want the faculty to find out about her plans.\nThen, Tsubasa suddenly feels a sharp headache. Araragi asks if she is fine, and she mentions having headaches lately. Hanekawa decides to take her leave, and runs out of the bookstore.\n\nAs he thinks about Tsubasa's condition, Araragi sees a familiar person standing in the occult section of the bookstore: Nadeko Sengoku. And she appears to be researching on snake curses. Since Nadeko has run out of the bookstore before he could reach her, Koyomi decides to look for her in the temple he and Kanbaru visited earlier.\nKoyomi enlists the help of Kanbaru for another trip up Kita-Shirahebi shrine that afternoon. He needed her help since he knows that Nadeko, a friend that he has not seen for a long time, might not be able to recognize him, so he needs someone who is good with talking with younger girls.\nHowever, on their way up... and upon seeing Sengoku preparing to take the life of another white snake, Araragi ends up talking to her.\n\nThat night, Araragi takes Kanbaru and Nadeko into his room for the first time. It was not the first time Nadeko stepped inside the Araragi residence, but Kanbaru was the one who made Koyomi quite uncomfortable, especially when she first looked for Araragi's stash of mature magazines and she revealed that she knew what Araragi's fetishes where when she stalked him in the bookstore.\nTheir exchange of remarks appear to put a smile on shy Nadeko's face.\nSoon, Nadeko decides to show the two something. After asking the two to turn around, she changes into a pair of bloomers, with her hands barely covering her breasts. Although it seems like an indecent exposure to some, a closer look by Kanbaru reveals that there are scale-like marks all over Nadeko's body.\nScales like that of a snake's.\nAs Kanbaru and Koyomi argue over how to react to Nadeko's show of her body, a sincere plea of help escaped from teary-eyed Nadeko's lips.\n\"Please help me, Koyomi-onii-chan!\""},"#New_Characters":{"link":[],"text":""},"#New_Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Bakemonogatari Episode 10: Nadeko Snake, Part 2","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Bakemonogatari_Episode_10:_Nadeko_Snake,_Part_2","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music","#Trivia","#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Nadeko Snake, Part 2\" (なでこスネイク 其ノ貳, Nadeko Suneiku Sono Ni) is the tenth episode of the Bakemonogatari anime series.","#Synopsis":{"link":[],"text":"Koyomi Araragi, after listening to Nadeko's plea for help, rushes to Meme's hideout that night. After telling Meme about Nadeko's case, Meme confirms that Nadeko is in contact of the jagirinawa, which can mean \"snake-cutter\", \"snake rope\" or snake-cutter rope\", and \"serpent\", occasionally. Regardless of the name, Meme tells Koyomi that this oddity is something that moves according to one's ill will.\nAraragi explains that Nadeko had rejected the feelings of someone in the past, and this probably triggered the unfortunate boy to resent Nadeko... and to curse her. Upon her discovery of the curse that has inflicted upon her, Nadeko began to research on how to counter the curse, and she thought that killing white snakes would cure her. However, it got worse, and Araragi thinks that she might have used the wrong method. Meme disagrees, however, and even tells Araragi that Nadeko is doing the right thing. But, he also points out that lifting a curse is much more difficult than casting one...\n...and with Nadeko's lack of knowledge when it comes to curses, she is just doomed to fail.\n\nAraragi later returns to his house, where Nadeko and Kanbaru wait for this return. Meme had given Koyomi an amulet and hands it to Kanbaru, then tells the two that they can use it to lift the curse from Nadeko. However, they should do the ritual needed on Kita-Shirahebi Shrine, and immediately. Koyomi quickly prepares everything needed, and while they allow Nadeko to change back to her clothes, he and Kanbaru go to the storage room to look for other things needed for the ceremony.\nOutside, Koyomi finally decides to brief Kanbaru into Nadeko's true condition. Of course, Kanbaru was surprised to hear that Nadeko was in a worse situation that she expected, and Koyomi tells her that they are currently on a race against time: the scale marks on Nadeko's body show that the Jagirinawa, in the form of an invisible snake, is slowly entwining itself around Nadeko, and when it reaches her head she would be beyond saving. Kanbaru thinks that such an experience would be painful, but Nadeko kept on smiling despite this. Araragi probably knew about Nadeko's pain, but decides to keep mum about it.\nKanbaru soon talks about the curse, and Araragi tells her that Meme had told him that the curse would not have taken effect since the caster is an amateur. But, a combination of mistakes of inexperience and sheer misfortune brought Nadeko to her current condition.\nAlso, one particular oddity also contributed to Nadeko's curse, and it was none other than Shinobu herself... the vampire, the king of oddities. Because of Shinobu's appearance, and Nadeko's decision to kill the snakes at that shrine, Nadeko ends up cursed. (It also caused Suruga's headache earlier.)\nKanbaru soon thinks that it might not be a good idea to perform the ceremony at Kita-Shirahebi Shrine if it escalated Nadeko's condition in the first place. However, Koyomi assures Kanbaru that they would be able to draw out and take care of the Jagirinawa if they follow the correct procedures.\n\nAfter the preparations have been done, Nadeko, Koyomi and Kanbaru head to Kita-Shirahebi Shrine. On the way, Koyomi finally decides to ask Nadeko about how she is feeling while under the effects of the Jagirinawa. Although a bit startled by the question, Nadeko tells them that it was \"like being squeezed, but not unbearable\". Araragi then assures Nadeko, telling her that it is okay to say that it hurts, since she has friends to support her in her pain. Then, Kanbaru proceeds to tell Nadeko that it is okay to be tied up, but not for a long time, which Araragi thinks is ignoring Nadeko's mental pain. In the middle of the banter between the two, Nadeko musters a smile of relief.\nThe three soon begin their ascent up the hill leading to Kita-Shirahebi Shrine. In the middle of the way to the shrine, Koyomi asks about Nadeko's decision to turn down the feelings of the person who ended up cursing her. Nadeko tells Koyomi that she already has feelings for someone else, and she reminds Koyomi of what happened in the past. Unfortunately, it seems that Koyomi's poor memory had failed him this time, and Koyomi soon finds himself in a bad position after seeing Nadeko's somewhat disappointed expression.\nKoyomi then decides to break the tension by commenting on how she remembered him very well. It turns out that Nadeko only got along with few people, including him and his younger sister Tsukihi. For some reason, Nadeko is a bit jealous to find out that she had an older brother.\n\nThe three finally reached the shrine itself, and they quickly set up the things they need. Araragi is shocked to find out that the clothes that Kanbaru chose to fit the requirement of \"being able to reveal enough skin to show that the scale marks are gone\" is a school swimsuit, and Kanbaru tells him that she just made the decision based on his preferences. Of course, he doesn't want to admit his \"preferences\" in front of Nadeko, but Kanbaru knows that she had hit the jackpot.\nWith that put aside, they placed the lights around Nadeko and asks her to sit on a rectangular sheet of cloth and to hold the charm tightly when she begins praying. After relaxing her lungs, Nadeko starts her solitary moment of prayer as Koyomi and Kanbaru watch.\nAs she prays, Nadeko reminisces on the day she met Koyomi for the first time. At that time, Koyomi is a sixth-grader, and Nadeko is a young child who has Tsukihi as a playmate.\nSoon, Nadeko's skin began to glimmer, and as the charm on Nadeko's hands begin to shine, the scale marks on her skin begin to flake off and float into the air like gold leaf. Araragi is relieved to see Nadeko close to being cured, but Kanbaru is more worried, now that Koyomi has yet another debt from Meme again. Koyomi tells her that it's not that case this time; since they just avoided a possibility for a spiritual world war by holding the ceremony here. According to Meme, the charm he gave for the ceremony was pocket change compared to what they just accomplished at that moment.\n\nMoments soon passed, and it looks like the ceremony is far from over. Kanbaru is becoming worried, but Koyomi tells her that when it is all over, they can just pull off the Jagirinawa from Nadeko's body. However, Meme had warned him against doing such a thing, since it can attack Koyomi instead. Also, there's a big chance that the curse would turn against its caster like in the saying, \"Curses, like chickens, come home to roost.\"\nThen, Meme tells him a reminder that puzzles Koyomi: \"One day, I might need to leave town. When that happens, I won't be able to give you advice anymore.\" Meme then adds that Koyomi is the type that meddles in affairs with oddities even though it is not advisable. Araragi tries to justify his actions, telling Meme that he cannot allow those things to happen in front of his eyes with impunity. Then, Meme suggests that it might be better if he had just forgotten everything, like what happened to Tsubasa Hanekawa, who never remembered about her involvements with oddities in the past. However, he took it back after thinking that it might be too rude.\nMeme decides to tell Koyomi that he would tell him ahead if he decides to leave for good, but he also reminds Koyomi that there are also much more important things to take into priority than the supernatural. Koyomi then proceeds to remind Meme that he will never become like him — he is 10% vampire, and an oddity himself. Meme tells Koyomi that he can let go of that 10% if he chooses to abandon Shinobu, and he doesn't want Koyomi to forget about that option.\n\nSoon, Koyomi wakes up to reality when Kanbaru notices something wrong with Nadeko. She is no longer the calm presence she was earlier, and it looks as if she is in deeper pain than before. As Kanbaru thinks that they might have committed a mistake as well, Koyomi notices something.\nThey might be actually overlooking a particular detail in Nadeko's case. The situation might have been less complicated if they were able to see the jagirinawa, but in this case, they easily discounted another snake entwining itself around Nadeko.\nThey are having an encounter with two Jagirinawa.\nIn a split-second decision, Koyomi dives straight into Nadeko, who is slowly losing her consciousness from being suffocated by the Jagirinawa. Unfortunately, he is unable to see the Jagirinawa, but he uses the marks on Nadeko's skin and holds on to whatever his hands could hold on to. It was there when he felt something long and round on his palms, and almost instantly, the sharp scales of the Jagirinawa cut through his skin.\nThen, the Jagirinawa bites hard on Araragi's arm, and it was at the moment that he became the target of the provoked oddity.\nAs Koyomi sees the Jagirinawa leave Nadeko behind, he suddenly finds himself fighting against a powerful beast that he cannot see. Another attack leaves his left leg broken as well, but he was able to retaliate by kicking it away. Then, the battle became a waiting game for Koyomi, whose broken leg and forearm renders him unable to move from his location. He tries to estimate the Jagirinawa's location by looking at the movements of dirt and grass nearby, and watches closely for any incoming attack.\nThen, the Jagirinawa prepares to charge towards Koyomi, and as he finds himself helpless against the attack, Kanbaru suddenly comes and pushes him away from the path of the speeding serpent. Meanwhile, the Jagirinawa escapes.\nKanbaru pins Koyomi to the ground and stops him from making unnecessary movement to slow down the flow of poison into his bloodstream. Meanwhile, she also tells Koyomi to reassess his priorities at this moment; right now, the Jagirinawa is no longer top priority, since Nadeko is now relieved of the curse. Unfortunately, this action meant leaving the boy who resented Nadeko for rejecting him to suffer and most likely eventually die from the very curse he cast upon Nadeko.\nNadeko finally comes to, and she thanks Koyomi for saving her. Although Koyomi considers himself, a \"half-assed oddity\", lucky to be able to stand up to a real oddity, and he refuses to accept Nadeko's thanks.

It is the first of the five-part Tsubasa Cat story based on the latter volume of the two-part original light novel. It was released on September 18, 2009, directed by Tomoyuki Itamura, who also worked on the episode's storyboard, with script handled by Yukito Kizawa.\nAfter being cured of the curse of the Jagirinawa, Nadeko tries to return to her normal life. However, Koyomi finds himself dragged back to the same problem that he encountered during Golden Week, when his friend Tsubasa Hanekawa encounters an oddity for the very first time.","#Synopsis":{"link":[],"text":"April 29th, the first day of Golden Week.\nKoyomi accompanies his friend Tsubasa on a walk across town. Here, Tsubasa explains that her parents are not bound to her by blood, with a stepmother and her husband as her companions at home, and that she knew all about this fact even before entering elementary school. This shocks Koyomi, who expects parents to tell this truth later in life. Meanwhile, Tsubasa continues to tell her story, telling him that she knew that her parents wanted her adopted to another family, but is keeping a facade to allow this to happen. On the other hand, Tsubasa decides to act like a \"good girl\", refusing to let the prejudices brought by her family life to affect her.\nTsubasa decides to break the topic by asking Koyomi about his plans for Golden Week. Koyomi wanted to take a break from studying unlike Tsubasa, while Tsubasa tells him that she is willing to do anything just to keep herself from staying at home.\nSoon, Koyomi takes the chance to ask about the bandage that's covering her left cheek. After asking Koyomi to not tell what she is going to say to anyone, Tsubasa reveals that she was hit by her father that morning. Koyomi is clearly upset by what Tsubasa had to experience, but Tsubasa expects it to happen to her, knowing that she might have acted too close to someone who was not familiar to him. Koyomi continues to voice out his protest over her father's attitude towards her, but Tsubasa did not budge. Instead of defending herself, Tsubasa is content to hearing Koyomi reiterate his promise.\nAs they continue to stroll across town, Tsubasa finds a cat lying on the side of a road and picks it up. As she puts the cat near her chest, she calls out to Koyomi and asks her if he would help out.\nKoyomi gives an affirmative response.\n\nBack to the present time, Koyomi hurries to get out of Naoetsu Private High School right after class and sees Nadeko Sengoku at the school gates, wearing her school uniform. Nadeko tells Koyomi that she visited him to school to personally thank him for helping her get back to normal; she also tried reaching Kanbaru, but she was too fast for Nadeko. Koyomi decides to volunteer in reaching Kanbaru for her, and in response, Nadeko hands over a neat stack of clothes (Kanbaru's swimsuit) , which are the same ones Nadeko wore the night before. It turns out that Nadeko wanted to meet Kanbaru to return her clothes, which she had washed personally.\nKoyomi finds himself having second thoughts about holding the same set of clothes that touched Nadeko's tender skin the night before, but pushes through anyway, living a rather short-lived moment of achievement for himself.\nHe soon shifts the topic to Shinobu, who accompanied them at the abandoned cram school building when they slept over after curing Nadeko's condition. Koyomi asks Nadeko if Shinobu told her anything that night, and Nadeko did not remember hearing anything from her. Nadeko soon remembers that it was Shinobu who was the reason why Koyomi became a vampire, but Koyomi assures her, telling her that she need not worry about oddities and she should return to living a normal life, although he still refers Meme whenever something related to oddities happens again... although Koyomi remembers that he should consider being less dependent on Meme's knowledge unlike Nobita's dependence on Doraemon.\nKoyomi tries to touch Nadeko's hair/face, followed by lifting her skirt gently (teasing). When Nadeko does not exhibit any reaction, Koyomi remarks how she judges his manlihood.\nNadeko soon asks once again about Shinobu, right after she remembers that Shinobu has been looking at her and Kanbaru in a different way than with Koyomi and Meme. Koyomi assumes that Shinobu looks at men and women differently.\n\nThen, Tsubasa notices the two talking and approaches them, although before Koyomi was able to introduce her, Nadeko quickly sprints away with a flushed expression on her face. (Tsubasa remarks that she feels hurt by Nadeko's running off)\nKoyomi introduces Nadeko to Tsubasa regardless of the former's absence, and Tsubasa promptly asks about what happened to the snake that attacked Nadeko. Koyomi frankly tells Tsubasa that the case has been dealt with and that they ended up helped by Meme in the end. Tsubasa, although not knowing the details, expresses her relief regardless.\nTsubasa then asks about his plans for today, and assumes that he was going to meet Nadeko, but Koyomi rejects her assumption and tells her that it is something about Hitagi. Then, she decides to spill some rumors about Hitagi, telling him that she has been acting different since she has started going out with him. Koyomi is a bit down after hearing this from Tsubasa, but Tsubasa actually meant to push Koyomi into improving his studies so that he doesn't end up tarnishing Hitagi's reputation by going out with him. Tsubasa also adds that she thinks that he should welcome these changes as well.\nAraragi, hearing those inspirational words from Tsubasa, thinks that there must be something... or rather someone... who is inspiring her to say those words, but as soon as his tongue spouts nonsense, Tsubasa suddenly looks pained. Although Tsubasa tries to assure him, Koyomi once again reminisces about that fateful Golden Week that passed...\n...the Golden Week when that white cat that Tsubasa Hanekawa buried triggered a series of events that resulted in her being possessed by a bakeneko.\n\nKoyomi, after seeing Tsubasa change her personality to that of a cat, quickly headed to Meme's place. There, Meme explains that Tsubasa has been charmed by a meddlesome cat (触り猫, sawarineko), but can be viewed in a realistic point of view as a case of multiple personality disorder. That is, a hidden personality was awakened, which Meme decided to call Black Hanekawa.\nIt is later explained that Black Hanekawa is a stress-triggered oddity that attacks people at night, where she drains victims of his or her energy, which is enough to hospitalize people. And two of those most affected by those attacks were none other than her parents.\nAt the end of Golden Week, May 7th, after almost being a victim himself, Araragi witnesses as a young Shinobu drains away the meddlesome cat's energy, curbing Black Hanekawa's string of attacks... for the meantime.\n\nKoyomi notices that Tsubasa's headaches are not the same as the pains she was experiencing last Golden Week, and expresses his worry about Tsubasa's well-being. However, Tsubasa refuses to accept Koyomi's concern, and instead tells him to worry about Hitagi more. Koyomi somewhat feels guilty that the very person whom he is concerned at is worried more about him.\nThen, as Tsubasa prepares to leave, she reminds Koyomi to put the school swimsuit and bloomers on his hand on his bag."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#References_to_Other_Media":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Bakemonogatari Episode 12: Tsubasa Cat, Part 2","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Bakemonogatari_Episode_12:_Tsubasa_Cat,_Part_2","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Music","#Trivia","#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Tsubasa Cat, Part 2\" (つばさキャット 其ノ貳, Tsubasa Kyatto Sono Ni) is the twelfth episode of the Bakemonogatari anime series, first broadcast on September 25, 2009.

This rule applies not only to humans or vampires, but even to herself, as she ate her severed head or heart after commiting suicide because of Princess Acerola.\nShe has stated that she keeps her only remaining servant, Tropicalesque, around her simply because he has a nice face.

In Koimonogatari he is shown having a cold shower to make his skin deathly blue-pale.\nIn most of Koimonogatari, he wears a typical trench coat with his hair down short and shaggy.\nIn Hanamonogatari, he goes back to his typical hair, but this time with a neatly trimmed goatee-beard combo and glasses."},"#Personality":{"link":[],"text":"Kaiki has a very gloomy personality and subscribes to the view that there is nothing in the world that is inherently true. The only absolute in life for him is money, as it is replaceable and can replace any thing. A schemer at heart, Kaiki has an opaque mind to outsiders. He is fluent in the arts of lying and subterfuge, so his reasoning behind what he says is constantly blurred. He explains his name as \"Kai\" like a mound of clam shells, and \"Ki\" like a dead tree.\nKaiki is an individual who prides himself in having no pride. He openly admits to being a conman and an impostor amongst other things. But this is to his advantage as someone who deceives with wordplay extremely well. His interactions with others are very fluid, and he is willing to give and take in order to maximize the outcome, or cut his losses, in his favor.\nIn Koimonogatari, much more of his character is revealed, especially his own thought process. He keeps his promises despite his lying nature, and has an unexpected system of morals that he adheres to - but only if motivated to do so because he must personally benefit from the situation. Kaiki seems to take warnings or \"pieces of advice\" as challenges, such as when Gaen and an unknown messenger (later revealed to be Senjougahara) had told him to \"pull out\" of his current job. Senjougahara explained to him afterwards that she had purposefully did it to motivate him.\nDespite the fact that he is very scheming, he seems to miss obvious conclusions. When he found the letter in his hotel room, he assumed that some third party (that wasn't Gaen or Senjougahara) had found a way to get in, but it was pointed out by Senjougahara that it could be as simple as throwing the envelope under the door. When trying to deceive Nadeko, he came up with the simple scheme of earning her trust so he can tell her that Araragi and co. were in a traffic accident so that she wouldn't kill them. It is worth mentioning that Kaiki already knew Araragi is almost immortal; and Nadeko had beaten him within an inch of his life many times within a short period, so she would have some idea of how much punishment his body can actually take, making something like a traffic accident seem less than lethal. During a discussion with Hanekawa, she described Nadeko as \"snubbing everyone out\", never letting others get close to her. Kaiki didn't change his plan despite knowing that she had never trusted others, and subsequently failed at deceiving her."},"#Background":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Meme_Oshino","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Yozuru_Kagenui","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tadatsuru_Teori","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Izuko_Gaen","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Occult_Research_Club","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Hitagi_Senjougahara","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Suruga_Kanbaru","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Izuko_Gaen","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tooe_Gaen"],"text":"Kaiki is a fake specialist who knows about paranormal creatures, but does not believe in them, so he prefers working as a conman by manipulating those who believe in oddities or just using his knowledge to make money by fooling people.

Kaiki arrived at the cafe, and upon seeing Senjougahara with a pair of Groucho glasses, he felt a sense of defeat. Feeling indignant, he bought and wore a Hawaiian shirt and sunglasses to wear during his rendezvous with Senjougahara. This resulted in Senjougahara spitting out her drink upon seeing him, he silently proclaimed his victory before they started conversing.\nSenjougahara then proceeds to repeat her request for him to deceive someone, saying that it's his atonement and threatening him in the process. She then explains the details of her request, telling him about the target that she wants deceived: the now current Snake-god, Sengoku Nadeko. She then tells him that Araragi, Shinobu, and herself were going to be killed by Nadeko after her graduation if nothing was done. While Kaiki asserts that he can successfully deceive Sengoku Nadeko, he does not immediately accept the job as he realizes that deceiving Sengoku Nadeko would not bring in any money at all. When Senjougahara offers 100,000 Yen upfront, he says it's not enough, and he later further asserts that no matter the amount Senjougahara can provide, it wouldn't be enough. He then goes to the toilet to contemplate if he has any reasons to possibly aid Senjougahara and Araragi.\nHis train of thought brings him toward many possible moral (and not so moral) reasons for him to help, such as atoning for his past or helping an innocent girl. However, for each reason he comes up with, he concludes that it's not an acceptable reason for him to accept the job. His conclusion was that there's nothing in it for him, and he would only stand to lose by accepting the job. He then remembers certain details about Kanbaru Suruga and comes to a conclusion that she is somehow connected to Senjougahara and Araragi. He then decides that he is willing to save his bitter enemies and deceive Sengoku Nadeko \"for the sake of Kanbaru Suruga.\" He then accepts the 100,000 Yen from Senjougahara only to have to pay for her return flight. \nAfter the meeting, Kaiki starts investigating and interacting with Snake-god Nadeko for a month. During his interactions and investigations, Kaiki is visited by Yotsugi Ononoki on behalf of Izuko Gaen to keep out of the case concerning the snake-god Nadeko. In the last visit by Ononoki, she confronts Kaiki about how his actions of dissolving the cult that manipulated Hitagi's mother and other acts of his were actually part of his inner side and that he would fail, because he was doing that again for Nadeko's case all which were acts that were not like his usual self. \nAt the time close to the death date, Kaiki's planned deception was discovered by Nadeko. Despite this, Kaki was still able to successfully \"trick\" Nadeko into becoming a human again. As he was leaving the temple grounds after briefly encountering Koyomi, Kaiki was attacked by a middle school boy who possibly had originally placed the Jagirinawa curse on Nadeko in Nadeko Snake. Before Kaiki lost conciousness, he heard the boy mention that he had gained information from Ougi about Kaiki's whereabouts and wondered about the person who had stalked him during his investigation on Nadeko and why the name mentioned sounded familiar.

Major plot points are mostly unchanged, though some story content is occasionally cut or altered slightly.\nThe novels are also notably more meta, especially featuring even more references to other anime, manga, and light novels and a self aware attitude in which the fourth wall is constantly broken. The novels even reference the anime adaptations, noting how certain parts may be hard to animate and mentioning voice actors of characters. The novels also have certain instances that refer to darker, more serious subject matter that are sometimes cut from adaptations.\nWith the exception of certain oddity characters like Seishirou, Kako and Kuchinawa who appear somewhat predominantly on some novel covers, no male characters, including protagonist Koyomi Araragi, are depicted in novel artwork, meaning their appearances are more open to the imagination in novel canon. As such, visual gags such as Koyomi's expressive ahoge are only present in the animated version.\nNotably, the manga adaptation came later, and therefore adapts elements from both the novels and animated versions while featuring a distinct canon that takes a few more liberties in altering the story.\nAs this page is a work in progress, many notable differences may still be missing.","#Bakemonogatari_(anime_series)":{"link":[],"text":""},"#General":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Specific":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Episode_01":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Episode_06":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Episode_09":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Bakemonogatari_(manga)":{"link":[],"text":""},"#General_2":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Specific_2":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Bakemonogatari_(anime_series)_2":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kiss-Shot_Acerola-Orion_Heart-Under-Blade","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Dramaturgy"],"text":"An opening montage sequence adapts brief visuals of events from Kizumonogatari.

Most of its structure is surrounded by wire fencing and several hazard signs, and the exterior is fenced off by metal scaffolding. Since the building was once used for educational purposes, chairs and tables are seen scattered in rooms. A tree without leaves and an empty water tank can be seen from the top of the building. The tree itself grows through the structure of the building from the inside.\nIn Kizumonogatari, the school is represented by an entirely different looking building. Rather than looking old and worn down, it's merely a clean, empty building complete with working elevators and lights. The large tree that normally goes through the center of the school up to the rooftop in the TV series has its own court yard type area in the middle of the school, complete with outdoor hallways that go around it. Classrooms appear to be in an auditorium style, also unlike the TV series. It also appears to be much higher than the buildings in the city, requiring vertical ascension on the nearby platforms in order to get there.\nThese were mostly stylistic changes for the films, as the building is canonically the same as in the TV series in the original Kizumonogatari novel."},"#Background":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Hanekawa","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsukihi_Phoenix"],"text":"Very little is known about the building.

After receiving Deishuu Kaiki's gift (which is the devil's head), Kanbaru then decided to challenge Numachi to an 1-on-1 for the rights of all the devil's parts.\nIt seems that Suruga is still worried about the effects of the Rainy Devil after it has been dispersed to the point that whenever she goes to sleep, she would bind her devil's arm to a pillar so that she wouldn't start sleepwalking and committing crimes and check the newspaper everyday so that she can make sure she didn't do anything unconsciously. She also has dreams of her mother once in a while which give her weird life lessons.\nHer mother and her father were revealed to have eloped as the Kanbaru family did not agree on their relationship.

Even in the absence of her parents, Suruga continues to wonder about why his father chose to wed Tooe Gaen, even if she considers her to be a devil than a mother to look up to.\nAfter that dream, Suruga wakes up on the morning on April 9, her left arm tied to a post before sleeping as Koyomi had requested. Suruga, with her hair much longer than before, begins preparing for school, which now feels different after both Koyomi and Hitagi have graduated.\nWhile doing her run towards Naoetsu Private High School, Suruga meets Ougi Oshino, who immediately clarifies that he is a male since birth and not the girl Suruga knew at school. Suruga shrugs aside Ougi's attempt to open a conversation about past as mistakes and a pessimistic view of the future, forcing Ougi to open a topic about something called the \"Devil Lord\" instead.\nSuruga soon goes to her classroom, which was used by Koyomi, Hitagi and Tsubasa before. Here, she is greeted by her classmate and basketball teammate Seiu Higasa. Due to her plans to get to a university, Suruga declines Higasa's offer to hang out with her; she later talks to Higasa about the \"Devil Lord\", and Suruga finds out that it is a rumor circulating in Naoetsu about someone who is willing to solve one's problems no matter what, although Ougi clarified that the \"Devil Lord\" is considerate enough to decline to requests where the police is a more viable solution.\nOvercome by the suspicions that it was she that is referred as the \"Devil Lord\", Suruga contacts Karen Araragi, now a high school student, to ask her about anything she knows. Karen sees no alarm towards the \"Devil Lord\" as do Tsukihi, and she also refuses to believe that a devil even exists. Regardless, Suruga eventually learns that the \"Devil Lord\" can be contacted by letter, by phone, or in person... and Suruga decides to meet the \"Devil Lord\" in the flesh.\nWith the help of Karen's information, Suruga meets the \"Devil Lord\" in an empty field, and she finds a familiar face waiting for her: Rouka Numachi, a girl who Suruga considers a nemesis in the basketball court. Rouka expresses her surprise for Suruga to choose meeting her in person, and she explains that she became the \"Devil Lord\", giving out advice for free to spend her free time after an injury has made her incapable of getting hired. For Rouka, being the \"Devil Lord\" is a source of peace of mind and a constant reminder that there are people who are more unfortunate than her.\nSuruga is repulsed by Rouka's \"occupation\", but Rouka assures Suruga that she only deals with little problems, and she generally does not do anything about the pleas of help she receives. Instead, she claims that the problems are solved on their own, and this improved her reputation.\nAs Suruga listens to Rouka's belief that most problems are created out of fear for the future, she wonders if things would have changed if she decided to endure her problem instead of trying to solve it herself. Soon, Suruga decides to part ways with Rouka, accepting that Rouka has been helping people in her own way despite the fact that she does not truly understood her. Rouka, on the other hand, shows disappointment that their reunion wasn't in a basketball court like in the past.\nThe encounter with Rouka Numachi eased Suruga's mind after finding out that the \"Devil Lord\" is not her.\nThen, the following day, Suruga finds out that left arm is no longer that of the Rainy Devil."},"#New_Characters":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Trivia":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Hanamonogatari_Episode_01:_Suruga_Devil,_Part_1","https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbakemonogatari.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FHanamonogatari_Episode_01%3A_Suruga_Devil%2C_Part_1%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D7&uselang=en"],"text":"Quotes[]"},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Hanamonogatari Episode 02: Suruga Devil, Part 2","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Hanamonogatari_Episode_02:_Suruga_Devil,_Part_2","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music","#Trivia","#Quotes"],"Description":"Suruga Devil, Part 2\" (するがデビル 其ノ貳, Suruga Debiru Sono Ni) is the second episode of the Hanamonogatari anime series.

Suruga eventually realizes the reality of her situation as she loses the athleticism and strength she had when the curse is still on her left arm.\nOugi once again talks to Suruga, this time informing her of how the \"Devil Lord\" has stopped receiving requests from people. Suruga also hears from Higusa about Rouka Numachi, explaining that an injury has taken her varsity scholarship from her, forcing her family to move to parts unknown.\nOn April 15, on a train station, Suruga meets Deishuu Kaiki by accident, and she discovers that she is unable to match Deishuu's pace using her own strength. Humiliated by the defeat, Suruga is at the verge of tears. Meanwhile, Deishuu confronts her about trying to run away from a problem, but later assures that he does not come to swindle her.\nDeishuu takes Suruga to a yakiniku restaurant, where Deishuu personally prepares meat for Suruga while she watches with caution.

Although still somewhat hesitant, Suruga receives the calling card. Then, Deishuu reveals that he knows about a mummified monkey's paw entrusted to her by her mother, much to Suruga's shock; Deishuu warns her to not use it, and instead leave its care to a collector.\nSoon, Deishuu decides to go so that Suruga could continue eating.

Still, Suruga refuses to hand over the devil's head to Rouka easily. Instead, she challenges Rouka to a one-on-one match—Rouka would stop her search for the devil's parts if Suruga wins, otherwise Rouka would gain possession of the devil's head.\nWith the added risk of Suruga destroying the devil's head herself, Rouka threatens Suruga that she will be serious in this match unlike the last. Suruga, on the other hand, knows that Rouka would not refuse, both as a basketball player and as someone who is desperate for the most important devil's part. She even makes the game a one-possession match, with Suruga standing as offense and Rouka as defense. Despite the fact that Suruga is giving Rouka her own advantage in the game, Rouka plays along.\nAs Rouka heads to the locker rooms to find for a shoe for her devil's left foot, Suruga exposes her anxiety over the fact that Rouka does not know that she is dead. This immediately becomes even more challenging for Suruga, now that she has to make Rouka realize the truth.\nRouka soon returns with two shoes fit for the match, and she reminisces on the fact that their games in the past were never official and this was their first serious game against each other. Suruga then begins the match by talking about Rouka about regretting things one has not done and things that one have done.\nAlthough intimidated about Rouka's famous \"swamplike\" defense, Suruga pushes on, fooling Rouka into receiving the ball she passed before attempting a dunk. Rouka tries to intercept the shot, but Suruga manages to make the dunk, causing both of them to fall to the floor. Afterwards, Rouka and Suruga burst into laughter. After making jabs at each other for doing unexpected things during the short match, Rouka reveals that she wasn't able to realize sooner that basketball was a team game, and she had quit before she had made that epiphany.\nSoon, Rouka accepts her defeat, and tells Suruga to go back to playing basketball like before.\nSuruga wanted to return her \"advice from the devil\", but Rouka was no more. Instead, the devil's part she took—a complete pair of ribs, a pelvis, the right shoulder, the left leg, and left hand—are all that remain. As she carefully gathers the devil's parts, Suruga slowly gathers her thoughts, and she realizes that she didn't hate Rouka in the end. Instead, she was jealous of her.\nAfter that fateful game with Rouka, Suruga dreams about a conversation with her mother. Here, Suruga talks about meeting Rouka again, and Tooe echoes her words about good and evil, medicine and poison, and being clear water. Afterwards, she wakes up naked to see Koyomi in her room. Suruga becomes flustered after being caught naked, but Koyomi sees no interest, especially after saying that he is more interested in his younger sisters.\nKoyomi soon praises Suruga for getting through an arduous feat that he admits would be too much for him. Suruga, on the other hand, decides to ask help to Koyomi about disposing of the other devil's parts in her possession, using Shinobu to consume them all. Koyomi feels that the devil's parts are still a cultural artifact that would be a waste to meet such an end, and he thinks that he could use them to wish for his siblings to be step-siblings in order to exploit a loophole in the law or to have them be blood-related. Regardless, Koyomi believes that wishing for something, whether one is capable or incapable of making it come true, is a merit in itself, otherwise, one's mind would be filled with doubt. Suruga wonders if this is the reason why she received the devil's left arm from her mother, but even Koyomi is unable to respond to it.\nSoon, Suruga decides to let Koyomi cut her hair. Although Koyomi has cut the hair of two other people in the past, he still thinks that someone professional should do it. However, Suruga insists, and soon changes the topic to her plans to visit Rouka's grave and to grant her wish of gathering the remaining devil's parts for Rouka's sake. Although Koyomi agrees to ask Tsukihi to help her locate Rouka's grave, he suggests to keep the devil's parts separated since it's safer that way.\nKoyomi begins cutting Suruga's hair afterwards. He reminds Suruga that there will be people who will agree to and question her decision.

As with some other Monogatari novels, it contains the BAKE part (化), and is composed of the simplified form of \"person\" (人) and \"period of time\" (頃). The character 頃 itself carries the original etymological meaning of \"katamuki,\" it's component radicals having originally symbolized a person inclined to on side (ヒ) and a head (頁).

From March 26th to April 7th, the full length of Spring Break, Koyomi learns of the existence of creatures called aberrations, and vampires in particular. Just in case, he says, he is unable to finish telling the story, Koyomi spoils the ending for the reader: the story will end tragically, with everyone involved becoming utterly miserable.\nOn the afternoon of Saturday, March 25th, Koyomi wanders around the gates of Naoetsu Private High School, hesitating to go home on his bike as a way of killing time. He comes across Tsubasa Hanekawa by chance, recognizing her; as he watches her adjust the braids in her hair, a gust of wind blows her skirt upward, exposing her panties to Koyomi (who, to his later dismay, spends several pages describing the sight in detail). This creates an awkward first impression between the two, who have their first conversation: she reveals that both know more about the other than they knew (they both not only know the other's name and how to write it, but he knows details of her exemplary school record). Tsubasa turns the conversation to a rumor making the rounds through the school, that a vampire is wandering the streets at night; she expresses a strong desire to meet it, \"an existence greater than humans\", as she finds the concept intriguing. Realizing that Araragi is fairly easy to talk to, she asks him why he has no friends,and he tells her that he pessimistically believes connecting with others would \"lower his intensity as a human\", and asserts his desire to be a plant, free from having to talk or walk or relate with others. As their talk winds to a close, she tells him she will be studying in the library and puts her number into Koyomi's phone, saying, \"You just made a friend.\"\nThat night, Koyomi leaves his house to buy a few porn magazines, theorizing he can overwrite the now-ever-present image of Tsubasa’s panties in his head with something else. At the stroke of midnight, as Spring Break officially starts, a power outage occurs, leaving only one street lamp lit on the road. As Koyomi walks down the now-darkened road, a voice calls out to him; looking in the direction of the voice, he sees a woman on the ground under the only lit street lamp, lying in a pool of her own blood, her arms and legs cut from her body. When a panicked and horrified Koyomi tries to call an ambulance, the woman tells him she does not need one, instead ordering him to give her his blood. As he realizes she is the rumored vampire, she introduces herself menacingly as Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade. Unable to accept the reality before him, he runs from her; realizing that she may die, the now-terrified vampire herself breaks down, crying tears of blood. A short distance away, Koyomi, upset with himself, throws his porn in a trash can and ponders the situation further. Thinking about the growing disconnect between him and his family, and also with those around him, he decides that she needs to live more than him, and that his existence is worthless. Resolving to be a better person in his next life, he allows the vampire to suck his blood. His last thoughts before the world fades to black are of Hanekawa.\nKoyomi abruptlly regains consciousness in a room on the second floor of the Eikou Cram School, with a very young blonde girl sleeping on his arm; checking his cellphone, he finds it is March 28th with the time at 16:32, and realizes he has been unconscious for several days. After failing to rouse the girl, he explores the building. The moment he steps outside, his entire body explodes into flames; hearing his screams of anguish, the little girl awakens and races to him, herself aflame as well, and drags Koyomi back inside, where, away from the sunlight, the flames vanish. The little girl then names herself as the same vampire whom he met several nights before. Koyomi's skepticism, quickly swept aside, leads to Koyomi questioning if Koyomi can ever become a human, and Kiss-shot agrees to do so, with a catch: before she can fulfill her side of the deal, Koyomi will have to defeat the three vampire hunters who stole her limbs, Dramaturgy, Episode, and Guillotine Cutter. Koyomi also receives a message from his sisters Karen Araragi and Tsukihi Araragi; to explain his disappearance, he replies to them that he is taking ”a journey of self discovery”, which they do not question. While Kiss-shot casually predicts that their problems will be settled that night, the truth is nothing of the sort; Koyomi is cornered by all three of the vampire hunters at a fork in the road, and has no idea how to deal with them. The three belittle Koyomi before launching an all-out attack on him. The only thing that saves him from them is the sudden appearance of Meme Oshino, an odd stranger just passing by, who blocks their crushing attacks with apparent ease.\nThey find Kiss-shot eagerly waiting for Koyomi. Seeing Oshino, who tells her that he has met her before, she has trouble placing his face, and he clarifies that he was the one who, several days ago, told her about the cram school. Koyomi tells Kiss-shot what happened, while Oshino reveals he has already set up a protective barrier around the cram school. As Koyomi wonders to himself about Oshino's role, Oshino formally introduces himself as someone with no permanent address whose specialty is working as a \"balancer\". Describing their situation as unbalanced in favor of the three vampire hunters, he offers to lend his services to them by negotiating with the three to give Koyomi three one-on-one fights, rather than fighting all three at once. Oshino asks for 2,000,000 yen as compensation; as Kiss-shot has no means of payment, she asks Koyomi to pay the price for her when he is able. Oshino decides to stay in the cram school until the battles are concluded. Midnight strikes, and the day becomes March 29th.\nAt around nine in the evening on March 31st, Kiss-shot talks with Koyomi about Dramaturgy, the pure-bred vampire who stole her right leg; Koyomi wonders why a vampire would feel compelled to hunt his own kind, but Kiss-shot maintains the practice's normalcy, stating that no species in existence does not hunt its own kind. After their talk, Koyomi goes to a bookstore to find a martial arts manual, looking for potential advantages going into his first fight, As he buys the manual, along with guides on baseball and classical music to avoid \"embarrassment\", he runs into Tsubasa again. Their conversation is fun but brief; as Koyomi tries to physically distance himself from her, she follows him, leading Koyomi to warn her, highly self-deprecatingly, to not wander around alone at night, saying, \"You might run into a vampire, you know?\" Koyomi asks Tsubasa why she wanted to meet a vampire in the beginning, to which she replies that she was simply curious to meet one. The reply, now seeming exceedingly petty to him, deeply upsets him; a confused Tsubasa watches as Koyomi, insulting her relentlessly, deletes her number from his phone. Sensing that something else is bothering him, she apologizes for passively forcing him to insult her and leaves. Koyomi is left with regret and confusion himself for what has happened to him so far, and even questions whether he truly wants to regain his humanity, but he comforts himself with the belief that severing his ties with Tsubasa \"must have done something -- to up [his] intensity as a human\" as he makes his way to Naoetsu High's athletic field, where Dramaturgy is waiting for him.\nBefore the battle begins, Dramaturgy asks Koyomi if he would consider joining his fifty-three brethren by betraying and killing Kiss-shot; he expresses reluctance to kill something as rare as a thrall of Kiss-shot's. Koyomi's refusal to concede sparks the start of the duel, which opens with Koyomi losing his left arm. To his surprise, it regenerates in an instant, and he distances himself briefly from Dramaturgy before re-engaging him. Using a technique he picked up from the martial arts manual, Koyomi is able to slam Dramaturgy into the ground and put him into an arm lock, but the massive man shape-shifts, turning his arms into the wavy greatswords that are his signature weapons and severing Koyomi's hands. Running away again, Koyomi dashes to the P.E. shed, grabs a few baseballs, and begins pitching them at superhuman speed toward Dramaturgy. Koyomi, grabbing for one last ball before Dramaturgy reaches him, grabs a shotput ball instead; its impact with Dramaturgy's face sends him to the ground in immense pain. Intending to finish the fight before his opponent can get to his feet, and fully aware of his increased strength, Koyomi hoists the field's concrete roller in one hand, swinging it like a baseball bat. Realizing it would take days to recover from such a blow, Dramaturgy surrenders, begging for mercy, and swears to Koyomi that he will return Kiss-shot’s right leg before vanishing completely. Out of thin air, his voice asks, one last time, if Koyomi would reconsider joining him. Koyomi's words of maintained refusal meet nothing but silence.\nAs he cleans up the mess left by the fight, Tsubasa, who watched the fight from the shadows, approaches him and returns his bag, with the three books still inside. Informing him that she witnessed the fight, Hanekawa offers to help Koyomi with his problem, but Araragi, still seeking to keep her distant, meets her words with arrogance again, to the point that he demands that she show him her panties once more. She does so without hesitation, and Araragi finally breaks, fully realizing for the first time the inner resolve and strength Hanekawa holds within herself, and coming to understand how weak he is in comparison. For the first time, he apologizes to her genuinely, and asks her to be his friend.\nKoyomi returns to the cram school and is greeted by Kiss-shot and Oshino, the latter of whom tells Koyomi that he also watched the fight and saw him making a girl pull up her skirt, to the apparent disapproval of Kiss-shot. Koyomi briefly explains the situation, and Oshino, apprising that Hanekawa is a bright person, suggests that Araragi explain the whole situation to Tsubasa for clarification. Kiss-shot interrupts their conversation, her own focus on the Boston bag Oshino has brought with him; he opens it the bag and removes from it the vampire's severed right leg, which Kiss-shot begins to eat (Koyomi remarks to himself, upon seeing this, that the prospects of an anime adaptation are now hopeless). Koyomi expresses his doubts to Oshino, wondering if Kiss-shot is lying about the need to regain her limbs, a sentiment Oshino sees as ungrateful on the part of Koyomi, who was saved by her. Koyomi recalls that Kiss-shot told him he would become a vampire when she sucked his blood, as if it were the only option, and Oshino relays the knowledge that Kiss-shot did, in fact, lie about this singular detail, as well as telling Koyomi the other option: death by being drained as a form of nourishment. Koyomi comes to realize that Kiss-shot has saved him as s sort of thank-you, and that she chose not to drink him dry to do so, at the cost of losing the majority of her original power. Oshino warns Koyomi against continuing to play the victim and encourages him to continue retrieving Kiss-shot's limbs. Koyomi resolves to face Episode, and the two re-enter the room to find Kiss-shot has finished devouring her leg and gained the form of a twelve-year-old.\nAfter sundown on April 1st, Koyomi explains the entirety of the situation to Tsubasa in the same room on the second floor of the cram school, while Kiss-shot sleeps next to them. Tsubasa realizes that she was somewhat at fault for relaying the rumors to him, and Koyomi again asks for the meaning of her question about wanting to meet a vampire. She answers that her actual reason was a desire to have a change in her life, which she deemed to be in need of something new. Tsubasa gives Koyomi a new change of clothes, sparking a fit of nervousness about changing in front of a girl. As he changes his shirt, she notices that Koyomi’s physique has begun to change; his muscles have become more defined and sharp. Kiss-shot abruptly awakens, says that vampires’ healing power causes their bodies to optimize their own physical condition, and dozes off again. Remarking that the vampire seemed to overlook her, Tsubasa starts stroking Koyomi’s body and commenting on how it feels compared to other people; when Koyomi wonders aloud if she has personal experience stroking people, she stops, clarifying that she is only imagining. He examines the paper bag Hanekawa has brought him, finding it to be filled with superpower manga and novels; she theorizes that he needs to think beyond baseball or aikido when using his newfound powers, rather than limiting himself with human constructs. Tsubasa also gives him a gift card for the bookstore as well; Koyomi expresses his gratitude to her. Offering to clean up the classroom, Tsubasa picks up a paper bag from the corner of the room, one that Koyomi recognizes as containing the two porn magazines he threw away on the first day of Spring Break. The half-asleep Kiss-shot randomly awakens again, announces that she brought it with her, believing it to be precious to Koyomi. After she drops back to sleep, a grinning Tsubasa takes one of the books and happens to open it to a feature entitled “Bespectacled Class Presidents,\" asking him, \"in the kindest of purrs,\" why he bought it.\nThree days later, on the evening of April 4th, Koyomi waits at the athletic field once again, this time for the half-vampire Episode, who is late for their duel. While Koyomi waits, he thinks back on the advice Kiss-shot offered him. While she initially forgot what she wanted to tell him, Kiss-shot remembered by driving her own hand into the side of her head and digging around in her brain, and proceeded to explain that the nature of half-vampires means they have almost no weaknesses, but half the strength of a standard vampire. She advises him to simply be his usual self. Koyomi also recalls a conversation with Oshino three days prior: he mentioned the barrier he set up might cause Tsubasa to get lost on her succeeding trips. He bluntly advised that Koyomi find someone else if Tsubasa stops helping, an idea Koyomi dismisses, as he has no friends beside her. His recollections finished, Episode finally appears; he reveals Oshino negotiated for the two of them to have a proper match for Kiss-shot's limb, not a fight to the death. Koyomi makes the first move, but Episode turns his body into mist and throws his cross towards Koyomi; it grazes his shoulder, setting him on fire and slowing down his regeneration. Episode's second and third throws are misses, but Araragi has no idea how to combat the giant cross or his mist-bodied opponent.\nTsubasa interrupts the match, yelling to Araragi about a potential weakness of Episode's, causing him to hurl his cross at her instead. The impact, while relatively small, tears her body open, leaving Araragi unable to stop the bleeding. As Koyomi tries desperately to save her, she returns his phone to him (the reason she came to the fight) and gives him a hint about how to beat Episode's mist-form movements, asking what his long jump record is before falling unconscious from blood loss. Understanding, he jumps as hard as he can into the sand pit at the edge of the field, throwing sand into the air and disrupting Episode's ability to reconstruct his physical form. Koyomi pins him down and strangles him into unconsciousness, nearly killing him in a rage before Oshino interrupts. Koyomi begs Oshino to find a way to save the dying Tsubasa, but Oshino simply tells him that such advice is not covered by their agreement. When Araragi agrees to pay him a further three million yen, Oshino concedes and hints that he should use his head. Koyomi does exactly what Kiss-shot did with her head, driving his hand into its side and dumping the gore directly onto Tsubasa’s body, repairing and sealing her wound. Shortly afterward, Tsubasa awakes to find an emotional Araragi clinging to her, his head on her abdomen, overwhelmed by the simple fact that she is alive. When Episode awakens in the early hours of April 5th, he helps Araragi and Oshino clean up the fight scene and returns Kiss-shot’s left leg to Oshino in a Boston bag. Episode apologizes for attacking Hanekawa and informs Koyomi that his next opponent, Guillotine Cutter, will be far more difficult.\nAfter consuming her leg, Kiss-shot takes the form of a seventeen-year-old slightly taller than Araragi. She then discusses the issue of Guillotine Cutter with Araragi: from what she can recall, he is an archbishop from a new religion that denies aberrations, pursuing and destroying them to preserve that belief. With sunrise nearing, she leaves the method of his defeat entirely to Araragi, and she and Araragi go to sleep. When Koyomi wakes up in the evening, he waits for Tsubasa to arrive, which she soon does. As they talk, Tsubasa sees Kiss-shot’s new form and asks Araragi if he gets urges to suck blood; he remarks that he has not since becoming a vampire. Koyomi then tells her to stop coming to see him, claiming he runs the risk of losing himself and his humanity for her sake, but his true reason is his fear of her: he does not understand why someone he barely knows, and who barely knows him, would go to such lengths and do so much for him. She rebuts him, telling him that she is acting so because she feels like it, not for the sake of \"self-sacrifice\" but rather for \"self-satisfaction.\" Koyomi asks her to wait for him until the next school year starts, and as a sign of the promise, Tsubasa gives Koyomi her panties and tells him to give them back to her at school. They bid each other good luck and part ways.\nThree hours later, a distraught Oshino unexpectedly returns to the cram school to announce that, due to his own error, Tsubasa has been kidnapped by Guillotine Cutter. Koyomi confronts Guillotinbe Cutter at the school’s track field, where he finds him holding Tsubasa hostage in one arm. Oshino claims responsibility for underestimating Guillotine Cutter’s tactics, revealing that he was the one who decided the time of the match – tonight, ignoring Oshino’s negotiations. Oshino urges Koyomi to forget everything, including his humanity, to settle the struggle. Guillotine Cutter tells Koyomi that Dramaturgy and Episode returned to their home countries, and that he has kidnapped Tsubasa in order to compensate for his newfound lack of powerful allies. Guillotine Cutter proclaims himself to be God, and his existence to be in opposition to that of Kiss-shot and Araragi, meaning that he cannot allow aberrations such as them to exist. Setting the terms of the match, Guillotine Cutter arrogantly declares the match will be over once Hanekawa is freed. His declaration becomes his downfall: remembering what Dramaturgy did with his arms, and recalling his own desire to become a plant, Koyomi shape-shifts his arms into plants like the roots of trees. They grow toward Guillotine Cutter faster than he can react, entrapping him and slamming him to the ground, and free Tsubasa in the process. While thankful for being rescued, Tsubasa makes a point of keeping her distance from Koyomi, since (thanks to him) she is no longer wearing panties.\nThe next day, on a rainy afternoon of April 6th, Koyomi roused out of bed and was greeted by Oshino. He suggested going to the fourth floor of the cram school to get something important. When they went there, Oshino held the last Boston bag carrying Kiss-shot’s arms. Koyomi was amazed that Guillotine Cutter gave it back even though he wasn’t actually interested in doing so. Oshino had to convince him otherwise. He also congratulated Koyomi in accomplishing the mission but Koyomi was skeptical of Kiss-shot’s limbs stolen in the first place. With Oshino now seeing Koyomi aware, he gave Kiss-shot’s heart and said she fought the three vampire hunters without it. Koyomi thought one of the vampire hunters also stole the heart too when in fact Oshino was the one who did it. By that confession, Koyomi was speechless. He admitted in committing it to balance the situation yet did not expect Kiss-shot to create a thrall. Even if she got her limbs back, Koyomi had to fight Oshino except he already gave back her heart. Nevertheless, Oshino felt sorry to Tsubasa for her actions and sees her kindness as disturbing. He eventually asks Koyomi if he’s been hungry lately. After Koyomi realized two weeks had passed, Oshino tells him to be careful next time. With that, Oshino headed to the exit to wander around town for a while longer though he did not say his farewell.\nIt was night time where Kiss-shot is now in her top form. Koyomi explained how Oshino stole her heart and his departure. Kiss-shot forgives him whereas Koyomi felt uneasy since he wanted turn back human. Likewise Kiss-shot will do it after her discussion with him. Her place to talk is at the rooftop of the cram school. Under the stars, Kiss-shot reminisce her first thrall with Koyomi and revealed that she lied to have someone collect her limbs. She also arrived in Japan 400 years ago when she met her first thrall; as a memoir of her first thrall, she drew the Kokorowatari from her own stomach. The sword Kiss-shot owns is a replica made from his flesh and original material. The first thrall was not able to live because he committed suicide by throwing his body under the sun right in front of her. He did this only after a short time being a vampire with no changes happening to him at all. After talking her life story, Koyomi tried to talk about something in his life but ended up in uninteresting humor. While talking, the clocked ticked to midnight bringing the date to April 7th, the last day of Spring Break. Koyomi perceives this as his most vivid memory with Kiss-shot. At the end of their discussion, they decided to have a meal first before turning Koyomi back to human. Past two in the morning, Koyomi bought food and was shocked to see Kiss-shot eating Guillotine Cutter halfway through.\nKoyomi and Kiss-shot argued about eating humans until Koyomi stormed out of the cram school and arrived at the high school’s P.E. shed. He shut himself in there for twelve hours until five in the afternoon. While hidden, Koyomi had a mental breakdown for ignoring what he saw right in front of him all this time. He failed to remember about Kiss-shot’s true nature including the fact he was also a vampire. Koyomi thought all hope is lost when he looked up his cellphone. Tsubasa’s contact number was there and he texted her to meet him in the shed. Tsubasa showed up to argue in not letting Koyomi die on her. She asserted his emotional and physical states trying to run away from what he has done. This crossed his mind to recognize he was being selfish. Tsubasa added to him being the only one who can beat Kiss-shot while she researched the master-servant relationship. In other words, if Koyomi fights Kiss-shot, he can turn back human regardless of her feelings. It is Tsubasa’s way of fixing things. To mentally prepare for it, Koyomi asked Tsubasa if he can touch her breasts. She accepted his offer to the point of stripping her bra. He soon realizes it cannot happen so he decided to rub her shoulders. Tsubasa called him a chicken and Koyomi complimented her. Koyomi regained his composure and heard a roaring sound outside of the P.E. shed.\nOutside of the shed was Kiss-shot waiting for him to come out. It was night by then. As Koyomi stood in front of the shed, Kiss-shot wanted him to return to her side for eternity. He refused and yet she was happy to face her own thrall. Kiss-shot set the rules of the fight to not use any vampire ability but raw power instead. Similarly, Koyomi asked what are humans to her and she sees them as food. By that statement alone, Koyomi made the first move. Kiss-shot did the same thing where she was enjoying the fight. From raw power, they were able to destroy their opponents with blood spreading and evaporating everywhere. The match was going nowhere with their bodies being torn apart then regenerating again. Out of the blue, Tsubasa came out of the shed claiming something was overlooked. Kiss-shot glared at her but only sent the door of the shed flying. This gave an opening to Koyomi sucking half of her blood becoming weaker. However, he looked back if Kiss-shot knew how she will turn him human. Tsubasa stepped forth to clarify if she intentionally wanted Koyomi to kill her in order for him to be human. Kiss-shot finally confessed in searching of a place to die. Through Koyomi’s actions, it was the first time in her life that someone helped her even if she was unable to die for her first thrall’s sake. Ironically she wanted to die all for Koyomi’s sake thus uncovering her plans that crumbled his mental capacity. Instead of tears blood has flown his face in which she demanded Koyomi to kill her to finish all of this. He hesitated and cried out to Oshino and completely understood of not becoming the victim but the offender. Oshino was there sitting on top of the roof of the shed and laughed at his naivety. After he came down he officially met Tsubasa as well then made a compromise for Koyomi to decide. Koyomi wanted a way for everyone to be happy. In contrast, Oshino's deal was to evenly split the misery where no one’s wishes will come true. Kiss-shot's abilities will almost be nonexistent and Koyomi will still have few vampire traits to feel as close as an actual human. For the rest of his life, Koyomi will nurture Kiss-shot by sucking his blood to survive. Kiss-shot sees this as foolish but Koyomi decided to not help her in the end.\nKoyomi’s life from now on, starting April 8th, his situation with Kiss-shot was resolved. He was roused by his sisters Karen and Tsukihi in which they laughed at him at his expense. When he went to school, he is now classmates with Tsubasa. She made a mistake in her lifetime in forgetting her bra at the P.E. shed. Koyomi wanted to get her bra as part of his collection back at home where Tsubasa wanted them back. Now, he still has vampire abilities but only the side effects were left. Tsubasa speculated if Kiss-shot actually wanted to have a partner just to find her reason to die. Koyomi considered it and was trying to hide his fang marks on his neck. In the end, Tsubasa promised to have a good year to him. Later, Koyomi went to the fourth floor of the decaying cram school. Oshino was there to look out to Kiss-shot now as a little girl who no longer speaks. Kiss-shot and Koyomi were not affected by sunlight anymore where he uses his blood to feed her everyday. Koyomi vowed to die with her if Kiss-shot dies tomorrow and live if she were to live today. Oshino lets Koyomi do whatever he wants and Koyomi declared to never tell anyone the tale of the wounded ones."},"#Illustrations":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/VOFAN"],"text":"Illustrations by VOFAN."},"#English_Edition_Color_Pages":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cast":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Anime":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kizumonogatari_(movie)"],"text":""},"#Manga":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Bakemonogatari_(manga)"],"text":""},"#Kizumonogatari_VR":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kizumonogatari_VR"],"text":"A virtual reality experience based on the anime film trilogy."}},{"id":"Kizumonogatari (movie)","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kizumonogatari_(movie)","toc":["#Plot","#Films","#Characters",{"#Presentation":["#Screen_Flashes","#Alternate_Color_Palettes_/_Intense_Lighting_Effects","#Abandoned_Locations_/_Main_Character_Bias","#Real-life_Footage_/_Imagery","#Back_and_Forth_%22Before_/_After%22_Cuts"]},"#Music",{"#Development":["#Prologue_and_Announcement_PV_vs_Final"]},"#Trivia","#Kizumonogatari_VR","#Trailers","#Videos","#External_Links"],"Description":"Kizumonogatari (傷物語) is the film adaptation of Kizumonogatari, the second book and origin story of the Monogatari light novel series.

During his visit, he received a call from Senjougahara trying to give him a job request to deceive someone. While he initially feigned ignorance, a string of lies followed with Senjougahara playing along with his lies end up having him having to fly to Okinawa to meet her.\nUpon his arrival at the airport, they decided to meet up in a cafe in the airport. Kaiki arrived at the cafe, and upon seeing Senjougahara with a pair of Groucho glasses, he felt a sense of defeat. Feeling indignant, he bought and wore a hawaiian shirt and sunglasses to wear during his rendezvous with Senjougahara. After Senjougahara resulted laugh caused her to spit out her drink upon seeing him, he silently proclaimed his victory before they started conversing.\nSenjougahara then proceeds to repeat her request for him to deceive someone, saying that it's his atonement and threatening him in the process. She then explains the details of her request, telling him about the target that she wants deceived: the now current Snake-god, Sengoku Nadeko. She then tells him that Araragi, Shinobu, and herself were going to be killed by Nadeko after her graduation if nothing was done. While Kaiki asserts that he can successfully deceive Sengoku Nadeko, he does not immediately accept the job as he realizes that deceiving Sengoku Nadeko would not bring in any money at all. When Senjougahara offers 100,000 Yen upfront, he says it's not enough, and he later further asserts that no matter the amount Senjougahara can provide, it wouldn't be enough. He then goes to the toilet to contemplate if he has any reasons to possibly aid Senjougahara and Araragi.\nHis train of thought brings him toward many possible moral (and not so moral) reasons for him to help, such as atoning for his past or helping an innocent girl. However, for each reason he comes up with, he concludes that it's not an acceptable reason for him to accept the job. His conclusion was that there's nothing in it for him, and he would only stand to lose by accepting the job. He then remembers certain details about Kanbaru Suruga and comes to a conclusion that she is somehow connected to Senjougahara and Araragi. He then decides that he is willing to save his bitter enemies and deceive Sengoku Nadeko \"for the sake of Kanbaru Suruga.\" He then accepts the 100,000 Yen from Senjougahara only to have to pay for her return flight. \nAfter the meeting, Kaiki starts investigating and interacting with Snake-god Nadeko for a month. During his interactions and investigations, Kaiki is visited by Yotsugi Ononoki on behalf of Izuko Gaen to keep out of the case concerning the snake-god Nadeko. In the last visit by Ononoki, she confronts Kaiki about how his actions of dissolving the cult that manipulated Hitagi's mother and other acts of his were actually part of his inner side and that he would fail, because he was doing that again for Nadeko's case all which were acts that were not like his usual self. At the time close to the death date, Kaiki then successfully \"tricks\" Nadeko into becoming a human again. As he was leaving the temple grounds, Kaiki was attacked by a middleschool boy who possibly had originally placed the Jagirinawa curse on Nadeko in Nadeko Snake. Before Kaiki lost consciousness, he heard the boy mention that he had gained information from Ougi about Kaiki's whereabouts and wondered about the person who had stalked him during his investigation on Nadeko and why the name mentioned sounded familiar. The boy attacked Kaiki's limp body again before Kaiki was left to bleed in the snow.

Prior to his experience during his last spring break where he met Tsubasa Hanekawa, he was rather asocial in high school, claiming that having friends would \"lower his integrity as a human,\" due to a negative experience during his first year. This ideology seems to have multiple implications, as his explanations seem to change slightly in different instances. In Koyomi Vamp, he describes it as an idea that being close to others could ultimately harm him. If his friends got hurt, he would also be hurt. It gives a person more weak points. In Ougi Formula, which describes the scenario that birthed this expression, explains it in a slightly different way. Instead, it shows how he found disturbance in the fact that a \"truth\" can be made just by numbers. Something doesn't have to actually be true, but if a majority of people say it is, it's treated as such. He has his own sense of what's right, and doesn't want to be a part of the \"majority rule\" in deciding justice. In either instance, both explanations support isolation and the idea that he would be stronger as a person if he was alone.\nHis experience with Hanekawa caused him to open up and be more open to making friends. He's a poor academic student, close to failing every class except math. At home, Koyomi is the only person who thinks that his family relationship is bad, while his younger sisters, Karen Araragi and Tsukihi Araragi, believe differently.\nIt is revealed through conversations that he's quite knowledgeable on anime as noted by Nadeko Sengoku, who appears to be a bit of a closet otaku. Other characters, Mayoi Hachikuji and Hitagi Senjougahara especially, seem to speculate that Koyomi is a lolicon.\nKoyomi has a desire to help those around him and believes strongly in taking responsibility for personal matters that he could have helped despite not being any of his business. This desire causes him to behave recklessly or abuse his regeneration powers when faced with dangerous situations. Koyomi's desire to help is often portrayed as his own selfish desire and seen by those around him as being too soft towards other people."},"#Background":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Sodachi_Oikura","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Meme_Oshino"],"text":"Koyomi is the eldest of three siblings, with Karen and Tsukihi as his younger sisters.

Although Meme Oshino helped him become more or less human again, there are several lingering side-effects such as enhanced vision, superhuman strength, and regeneration.

During this same event, he also met Tsubasa Hanekawa, who changed his perception on making friends.\nIn his third year of high school, he becomes Tsubasa's class vice president on account of her wanting him to \"turn his life around.\" This makes the two of them responsible for planning events and dealing with other class affairs."},"#Koyomi_Vamp":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kizumonogatari","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Vampire","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kiss-Shot_Acerola-Orion_Heart-Under-Blade","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Meme_Oshino","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Dramaturgy","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Episode","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Guillotine_Cutter","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Oddity","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Seishirou_Shishirui"],"text":"On the day of the closing ceremony of his second year of high school and the very start of spring break, the anti-social Koyomi met Tsubasa Hanekawa for the first time after wind had blown her skirt up, revealing her panties. Through this odd circumstance, the two become friends, and Koyomi's friendless philosophy was supposedly broken.\nLater that night, Koyomi couldn't stop thinking lustful thoughts after seeing a girl's panties in person. After sneaking out of the house to purchase a porn magazine at the book store, he ends up encountering a limbless vampire who demands him to give his own life so she can live. He eventually panics and runs away, but changes his mind after hearing her cry for her life. He offers his blood to save the vampire, ready to die.\nWhen he awakes, he finds he never died, and that the vampire had turned into a 10 year old girl. After she saves him from the sun after it had caused him to catch on fire, she reveals that her name is Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade. She explains that he can turn back into a human if he gets all of her missing limbs back from the vampire hunters that stole them from her. Well encountering these vampire hunters for the first time and nearly being killed by them, a strange man named Meme Oshino came to save him.\nWith his help, Koyomi was able to negotiate with each hunter and battle each 1 on 1 for the limbs. He fought Dramaturgy, the vampire slaying vampire, Episode, the half-vampire, and Guillotine Cutter, the human priest that aims to destroy all unholy oddities. Through out these battles, his relationship with Hanekawa grows, despite attempting to rudely push her away to prevent her from getting harmed. She ultimately gets wrapped into the fights, causing him to save her. His use of vampire powers also escalates with each battle.\nOnce he succeeds in obtaining the stolen limbs (and the heart, secretly stolen by and being kept by Oshino), Kiss-shot returns to her original form. The two chit-chat for a while and get along quite nicely. Before Kiss-shot reveals how she'll turn him back into a human, Koyomi goes on a trip to the store to get some snacks. Upon his return, he walks in on her savagely eating Guillotine Cutter. Shocked and outraged, Koyomi runs away and contemplates suicide for reviving a monster that eats people. Hanekawa convinces him to live and encourages him to slay Kiss-shot himself before someone else could be eaten. She nearly allows him to touch her breasts as means to \"prepare him for the fight,\" but he changes his mind at the last minute, realizing that it's not something \"friends\" were normally supposed to do.\nHe battles Kiss-shot with the intent to kill her. The fight ultimately seems pointless, as the two regenerate at extremely rapid rates, healing all seemingly fatal wounds almost instantaneously. Through this fight, her true intentions are revealed. After sucking her blood to the brink of death, Kiss shot admits she planned on having Koyomi kill her. That way, she could finally find a proper way to die and allow a minion of hers to turn back into a human, as the death of the master causes the servant vampire to regain humanity. This would relieve her of her guilt regarding her first minion, in which she was unwilling to save long ago. Instead, after having her plan revealed, Koyomi rejects it as he doesn't want to kill her. \nWith the help of Meme Oshino, he finds a compromise that leaves no one's wishes granted. Instead of killing her completely, he would get her to the brink of death, weakening her power, making him as close to human as possible. In return, she'd be so weak that she wouldn't even be able to take the same name anymore, nor hunger for humans. In order to keep her alive, Koyomi would occasionally feed her his blood. This plan goes through. The now unnamed vampire holds a grudge and refuses to speak.

He suggests Tsubasa should check the school's curriculum, and maybe he'd understand. \nBack at school, Hanekawa explains to Koyomi that the school offers woodworking classes to the first year students, and the misshapen wooden house was a likely a class project that was put in the flowerbed with the stone to avoid throwing it away.

On the other hand, Karen thinks that his view of Tsubasa is understandable, and doesn't seem to differentiate love with lust.\nKoyomi soon meets Tsubasa by chance and they have a quick stroll. Here, he finds out that Tsubasa was hit by her father that morning, and her cheek was covered by bandages because of that. She makes him promise not to tell anyone before he decides to help her by using his vampire blood to heal the wound on her cheek.

In his need to borrow the nameless vampire's oddity-killing sword: Kokorowatari, he pleaded to her for days. Eventually, he managed to make her lend the sword to him.\nSoon, he concealed the sword in his body and lured Tsubasa into coming to the ruins of Eikou Cram School. There, he finds out that Tsubasa has a degree of control over the sawarineko that apparently \"possessed\" her, and that her actions as the oddity were fuelled by her own thoughts. Enraged by this, Tsubasa attacks Koyomi and splits him in two, and ends up being injured by the Kokorowatari.

It was previously believed that Akio Watanabe, who supervises the character designs for the anime series, was responsible for his design, but VOFAN later corrected this on Twitter by showing his illustration that predated the anime series.[7]\nThe kanji for his given name (暦 koyomi) means calendar. Likely to reference the wordplay, the Koyomimonogatari app that distributed the anime adaptation of the same name features calendars.\nWhile there is no direct or canonical narrative reason for his hair being slightly different in Kizumonogatari, it could likely be meant to represent his difference in personality in the story. Theoretically, he could have started covering his left eye instead of his right after the events of Koyomi Vamp had changed him.\nIt seems he still has vampire fangs although it's not shown much. The fangs are visible in Episode 1 of Bakemonogatari when he's about to pull a staple from his mouth.\nLater in the series when the two come to terms with each other, Shinobu Oshino commonly refers to him as \"Omae-sama,\" meaning \"you\" with the -sama suffix used for extreme formality. In old Japanese when she first visited Japan, the word \"omae\" was formal, but it now is considered rude, making Omae-sama sound somewhat ironic, likely past her intentions.\nKoyomi has a fetish for short-haired girls; a fact that caused Tsubasa and Hitagi to change their hairstyles during summer vacation. While likely not necessarily related to his fetish, almost all heroine characters besides Mayoi are also depicted with short hair at some point in the series. The change in hair style is typically used as means to display change and or growth in their character.\nIn early 2016, Koyomi won the second annual best guy voting contest on the subreddit r/anime[8]."}},{"id":"Koyomimonogatari","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomimonogatari","toc":["#Etymology","#Synopsis","#Plot","#Illustrations","#Anime","#Trivia"],"Description":"Koyomimonogatari (暦物語) or KOYOMIMONOGATARI: Calendar Tale in the English publication, is the eleventh part of the Monogatari series.

Tsubasa takes Koyomi outside to see for himself, and indeed there was a stone inside a shrine in the courtyard.

She then notes that the shrine didn't exist 2 years ago, and presumes that someone placed the shrine there within the 2 years.\nAt night, Koyomi goes to visit Meme and question him about the stone. Although Meme says that the stone doesn't involve oddities, he decides to make a note of it regardless. Meme states that physical objects turning into oddities aren't rare, and questions whether it's being worshiped because it's an oddity, or it became an oddity because it was worshiped. Koyomi claims he doesn't see a difference in the assumption, to which Meme tells him to draw a picture of the stone shrine. When shown the sketch, he laughs and says that he remembered seeing a similar shrine somewhere, but he couldn't remember where, while Koyomi states that he also remembered seeing a similar shape somewhere. Meme claims that he couldn't solve the mystery,  but tells Koyomi to tell Tsubasa to look into the school curriculum for answers.\nThe next day, Koyomi relates what Meme said to Tsubasa, and she immediately realizes the situation. During the first year, all students had to choose an art class: while Tsubasa took fine arts, there were other classes available including calligraphy and woodworking. She then states that one of the projects in woodworking was to create a house, and deduced that the shrine was the result of a failed wooden house that the student was too embarrassed to bring home: while sneaking the failed project into the school trashcan, the student came across the stone and decided to use the project as a shrine, as by itself, both the house and stone were nothing. This allowed the student to presume that he or she created a stone statue that could be worshiped. Tsubasa then asked whether Koyomi took woodworking, and if he made something similar, to which Koyomi admits he did.\nEmbarrassed, Koyomi sprints down the hallway to the stone shrine, destroys it, and throws it out, now realizing that he was the one who enshrined it in the first place. Koyomi then remembers Meme's question, and understands that his actions turned the stone into the abnormal. Koyomi decides to ask Tsubasa whether he was abnormal for not appreciating the normal, before realizing that the stone was, this whole time, just a piece of concrete."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Koyomimonogatari Episode 02: Koyomi Flower","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomimonogatari_Episode_02:_Koyomi_Flower","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Referbacks","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Koyomi Flower\" (こよみフラワー, Koyomi Furawā) is the second episode of the Koyomimonogatari anime series, first broadcast on January 16, 2016.","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Hitagi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Eikou_Cram_School","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Meme"],"text":"On May 9, Koyomi and Hitagi were walking back from the Eikou Cram School, having cured Hitagi of her weight problem.

Hitagi notes that, aside from the crab, she hasn't had any encounters with any oddities.\nJust then, Hitagi attempts to cross the road, but is held back by Koyomi. After berating him for touching her, Hitagi notes that there's a bouquet of flowers across the street. Both deduce that there was a traffic accident that happened here recently, and Koyomi guessed that the victim was hit because of the bouquet. The bouquet reminded Hitagi of a \"scary story\" regarding a similarly-placed flower on top of Naoetsu Private High School's roof top, which was usually off-limits, although Hitagi said she was able to sneak on because she was an honors student and took keys from teachers to find herself a safe place from people who could've discovered her secret. She notes that, although it wasn't an oddity story, it was nonetheless a mystery story, since no one has ever died at the high school.\nKoyomi relates the story to Meme, who states that the story won't pay off Hitagi's debt. His reason was because accidents happened all the time at the intersection where the first bouquet was found. Similarly, although no one has died, the rooftop where the second bouquet was found was still a place prone to danger, as there were no fences on the roof. Meme then states that there was no oddity involved in the situation, since the reason for the deaths was the placement of the bouquet, and that although the flowers may be the cause of the accidents, the reverse may also be true.\nKoyomi doesn't relay the story to Hitagi until the end of May. The bouquet was placed on the roof to deter people from going onto the roof, as people would assume that the bouquet were for someone who died there. The bouquet ended up being useless, since a rumor spread that someone had scaled the school to reach the rooftop, causing the school to renovate the rooftop. Koyomi - who was the person in the rumor - told Hitagi that they should keep it their secret or else they both would get in trouble, but Hitagi disagrees, telling Koyomi to forget it instead."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Koyomimonogatari Episode 03: Koyomi Sand","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomimonogatari_Episode_03:_Koyomi_Sand","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Referbacks","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Koyomi Sand\" (こよみサンド, Koyomi Sando) is the third episode of the Koyomimonogatari anime series, first broadcast on January 23, 2016.","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Meme"],"text":"In June, Koyomi meets up with Hachikuji again as they go through their usual tongue-biting gag.

After giving her the money, Koyomi listens to Hachikuji's story and goes to investigate a sandbox.\nKoyomi notes that the sand in the sandbox had created a face reminiscent of a demon, and thinks about the story Hachikuji told him: that the face would reform even after playing around with it.

Ougi then said that they needed to continue what her uncle started and create a backup plan, since they never knew whether another oddity like Shinobu would arrive and disturb the balance.\nOugi explains that the shrine used to be located somewhere else before it was moved, and questioned how people were able to move the shrine. Koyomi hypothesized that the shrine was taken apart and then transported, but Ougi revealed that it would've been harder, since there wasn't a path to the shrine before. Koyomi then added that a path could've been simply opened, but Ougi states that that would also be difficult, since the mountain is sacred. Koyomi then wonders whether the shrine's movement was supernatural, but Ougi shuts that down as well. She then reveals why she came to the town: to discover what a white snake really is\nLater, Koyomi consults Sengoku, who explains her theory that, in order to do the least work possible, the shrine was built out of the wood cut down to make space for it. When Koyomi brings up that the shrine was moved, Sengoku responds by saying that the relics were moved, and that there wasn't a point in moving the entire shrine. Koyomi then realized the mistake: the shrine, being a place of worship, disturbed the balance on the mountain.\nSengoku then asks whether the shrine would be rebuilt, and Koyomi wonders what would happen if it was rebuilt; he believes it doesn't matter, since faith and oddities would continue to exist. Sengoku states she believes that, if the shrine was rebuilt, the place would be balanced and the snake god (she initially calls him \"Kuchinawa\") would return. When asked if he agreed, Koyomi nodded, however he questions whether it would truly be good. Koyomi gets a bad feeling and thinks about the talisman Gaen gave him as Sengoku stares at his adult magazine drawer."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Koyomimonogatari Episode 09: Koyomi Torus","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomimonogatari_Episode_09:_Koyomi_Torus","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Referbacks","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Koyomi Torus\" (こよみトーラス, Koyomi Tōrasu) is the ninth episode of the Koyomimonogatari anime series, first broadcast on March 5, 2016.","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Season_Episode_15:_Nadeko_Medusa,_Part_4"],"text":"In December, Koyomi and Shinobu exchange morning greetings as Shinobu deduces that Koyomi was going to get some donuts.

He tells Shinobu that, if she's paranoid, then she should test the donuts; she ends up taking a bite out of Hitagi's donut and realized she loved it. However, when Koyomi tries to take one, Shinobu claims that her poison testing hasn't ended yet and tries to take the rest for herself. Koyomi tries to negotiate, but Shinobu points out his failure at negotiating with Sengoku and blames him for hiding the talisman in an obvious spot, and claims that she could've hid the talisman in a better place. Going back to the donut topic, Shinobu makes a bet with Koyomi: she will hide the donuts in 5 minutes, Koyomi has to find the hidden donuts in 5 minutes, and the donuts that weren't found are Shinobu's. She then pulls her leggings out to act as a blindfold.\nIn the aftermath, Koyomi was able to find three of the donuts, but was unable to locate the last one. Believing that Shinobu wouldn't have cheated by eating it, he called Tsubasa - who is traveling in search of Meme - asking for her guess. She first called him a pervert for using Shinobu's leggings before guessing that the final donut may have been hidden in the largest donut, which was previously split in half to add cream in between.

Koyomi assumed that one of them were going to give the other a piggy back ride, but Ononoki states that it's ineffective, and that Koyomi should stand on her instead. As Ononoki walks around town, Koyomi asks how he's going to find what she's looking for, especially since he's recently been using his vampire powers excessively. She responds by telling him to find something out-of-the-ordinary before questioning how much time Koyomi has before he's killed by Sengoku. Koyomi himself isn't sure, as the exams end first, but the results come out after graduation, and reveals that he's been using his vampire powers to survive his meetings with Sengoku.

This time, however, he meets Gaen, who has apparently been waiting for him.\nGaen revealed that she was the one who took Kagenui out of the picture, as it took out Ononoki as Koyomi's protector. She theorized that there were two possible outcomes: either Ononoki became powerless, or she becames more human, allowing her to protect Koyomi in her free will.

She then asks if Koyomi considers himself to be the king, in which Koyomi denies it. Gaen applauds his modesty before saying that there currently is no king in the town, meaning that there will be no victor or loser. Gaen wants to fill in the void, and entrusted Koyomi with the talisman to fill it in. However, Koyomi has yet to use the talisman properly and that, with the other oddity specialists currently off the map, the responsibility to save the town is now left onto Gaen. Her responsibility: to stop Koyomi from acting.\nHowever, Koyomi tells her that because of Ononoki, he couldn't act. Gaen reminded him that Ononoki is now powerless, and therefore Koyomi was free to act. However, if he was to act, then \"the other side\" would as well, and Gaen considers both of them dangerous.

Since her death, she became an oddity who has haunted people that have the urge to avoid going home. She later becomes the goddess of the North Shirahebi Shrine.\nShe is the titular protagonist of five main arcs: Mayoi Snail (Mayoi Mai Mai), Mayoi Jiangshi, Mayoi Hell, Mayoi Snail, and Mayoi Snake, and seven minor arcs: Mayoi Room, Mayoi Castle, Mayoi Name, Mayoi Ghost, Mayoi Escargot, Mayoi Heaven and Mayoi Welcome.","#Appearance":{"link":[],"text":"Mayoi is a young girl with long black hair and dark red eyes. Her hair is tied into pigtails and she wears a white headband with a white swirl on each end. Her outfit resembles an elementary school uniform: a white blouse with two straps connected to a dark blue skirt; white socks; and pink shoes.\nOne distinguishing part of Mayoi's overall look is the large pink backpack she always carries on her back. It is an unusual piece of baggage which looks like a large chick, containing different things such as large paw and several small plush dolls. Araragi once noted that Mayoi looks different if she takes off the backpack, as if a snail was turned into a slug."},"#Name/Etymology":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi"],"text":"At one point, Koyomi gets revenge by making fun of her name in return, calling her \"Hachihachiji\" and \"Hachishichiji\". Mayoi complains that her name is losing a temple and several temples when he says it. He then calls her \"Hachirokuji\".\nIn doing this, he substitutes for the \"ku\" (number 9) syllable in her last name (between \"Hachi\" and \"Ji\") other numbers: \"hachi\" (8), \"shichi\" (7) and \"roku\" (6). Effectively devaluing her each time he names her.\nDue to this, one could think of her surname as being shortened to \"89ji\".\nHer name is spelled 八九寺 and the \"temple\" reference refers to her name meaning \"89 temples\".\nMayoi's first name can be read in a number of ways. Reading the original kanji of her name gives the meaning \"true\" and \"evening\". Alternatively, it can be read as \"迷い\" which means \"to lose one's way\".\nLikewise, Mayoi's last name Hachikuji has alternate interpretations. Although the name consists of the characters for \"eight\", \"nine\" and \"temple\", the kanji for \"eight\" and \"nine\" can also be read as \"yaku\" together, which means misfortune (厄). 89th temple could refer to a trope of Buddhism where only 88 temples are allowed to go on a procession and so being the 89th temple is a sign of misfortune."},"#Personality":{"link":[],"text":"Befitting her age, Mayoi is cheerful, energetic and inquisitive. She makes a lot of spelling mistakes and has a habit of mispronouncing Koyomi's family name. In the end, it is revealed that she purposely mispronouncing it. On the other hand, she does not easily trust strangers, and will even fight back against them if they become too nosy. This cold nature towards strangers was later revealed to be intentional, as she was trying to discourage people from following her and becoming lost. She also shows a timid side around people whom she finds frightening (e.g. Hitagi, who admitted her dislike for younger girls). Although, she overcame her timidness after becoming a god, being able to casually greet and talk to the death-prepared, death-inevitable, death-certain vampire, Deathtopia Virtuoso Suicidemaster who was even tempted to kill and devour her, prompting the vampire to think “this girl didn’t even fear gods—though she herself was a god”.\nOn the other hand, despite her 11-year-old appearance, Mayoi frequently shows moments of maturity, especially when listening to Koyomi's problems and dealing with things that are difficult for people of her age."},"#Background":{"link":[],"text":"Mayoi came from a broken family, with her mother divorcing from her father at an early age. After the divorce, her father was granted custody over Mayoi, and the lack of contact with her mother eventually made the young Mayoi forget what her mother looked like.

Sadly, during her search for the address of her mother's home she was involved in a truck accident, killing her at the day before Mother's Day, on May 14.\nAfter becoming a haunting spirit, Mayoi continues her quest to look for her mother's house for the next decade, completely alone and actively push people that want to help her away so they won’t get affected by her power.

After she refuses his help, and later ignores him, Koyomi surprises her by hitting her head into the sign, during a hostile exchange Mayoi introduces herself. They get into a brawl, ending with Koyomi as the winner. Koyomi proceeds to get aid from Hitagi about helping Mayoi find her way. After a question from him Mayoi admits that she is not a lost child, but is in fact a lost snail.\nAfter talking with Mayoi, Koyomi discovers that the young girl is trying to get to a relative's house. However, as he, Mayoi, and Hitagi try to make their way to the address, they keep getting inexplicably lost. Koyomi then decides to send Hitagi off to find Oshino while he stays behind with Mayoi. Mayoi reveals that the relative she is trying to visit is her mother, and mentions that she has always been trying to get to her mother's house, but can never seem to get there. She and Koyomi get into an argument and briefly fight.\nTsubasa Hanekawa then arrives, saying that she was passing by. She asks Koyomi about his relationship with Hitagi, but he isn't able to give her a definite answer. After Tsubasa leaves, Koyomi receives a call from Oshino, who says that he has given Hitagi instructions on how to solve Mayoi's problem.\nWhile waiting for Hitagi to arrive, Koyomi begins to find out more about Mayoi's life. She is the only child of a couple that had undergone a bitter divorce. Mayoi was put under the custody of her father, and had any contact with her mother deliberately cut off to the point where Mayoi could barely recognize the face of her mother.\nHitagi then arrives and apologizes to Koyomi. She reveals that Mayoi does not exist, as she is actually dead. As a ghost, she can only be seen by those who have a subconscious desire not to return home. As a result, Hitagi could not see Mayoi and didn't say anything because she feared that she might be \"different\" again. The information Oshino provides helps them find Mayoi's mother's house, but it is now a vacant lot. However, Mayoi is happy and disappears, saying she's finally home.

However, after returning to the present, Koyomi and Shinobu find out the whole town is infested with zombies. In this timeline, Koyomi has not met Mayoi, and was unable to find Shinobu. This, in turn, allowed Black Hanekawa to kill him, causing Shinobu in this timeline to vow to destroy the world and make zombie vampires or \"jiangshi\" from humans.As Koyomi and Shinobu attempt to look for other survivors in the vicinity, they manage to attract nearby zombies. However, they are managed to be saved by a 21-year-old Mayoi Hachikuji, who learned how to combat zombies from the knowledge Meme Oshino had taught to her. After learning that the strangers she met are Koyomi and Shinobu, Mayoi hands out a letter containing a request by Meme Oshino, as well as his response to Shinobu's rampage.\nIn spite of the relief in seeing Mayoi survive the worldwide catastrophe, Koyomi chooses to part ways from Mayoi in favor of meeting Shinobu, who regained her powers as Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade, in order to stop her. The ensuing confrontation allows Koyomi and Shinobu to return to their present time, although at the cost of being unable to save Mayoi from the accident eleven years ago.\nUpon returning to the present time, Koyomi reunites with Mayoi the wandering spirit and soon asks about her sentiments about dying.

They managed to escaped with the help of Yotsugi Ononoki.\nThey ended up in the abandoned cram school. Shinobu reveals that during her first visit to Japan, 400 years ago, she saved the local people from a severe drought by accident and was revered as a goddess by them. She then spent the next years living as a goddess in Japan until all the villagers started disappearing mysteriously, until only Shinobu and a demon hunter she befriended remained.\nSoon after, the same being that Koyomi met attacked them and Shinobu barely escaped alive, taking with her the demon hunter's hand by accident, which she used to revive him as a servant of hers just like Koyomi. However, the man blamed her for all that happened and unable to reason with him, Shinobu watched him committing suicide by exposing himself to the sunlight. Since then Shinobu never returned to Japan until six months ago, when she and Koyomi first met.\nAfter Shinobu tells Koyomi her story, they realize that Yotsugi was overhearing their entire conversation and after Mayoi awakens, they start discussing ways to deal with the darkness being before it appears before them. Koyomi, Mayoi and Yotsugi manage to escape again, but Koyomi is knocked out cold by the shock of Yotsugi's jumping just to awaken several hours later and learn that they unwillingly left Shinobu behind.\nAs Koyomi's vampire powers had not disappeared yet, they conclude that Shinobu is still alive but with Koyomi's powers weakening, it means that they have to find her before she is killed for good. Having no clue about what to do, they decide to contact Izuko Gaen who might provide some advice and when they decide to take shelter in a house, Izuko herself opens the door for them, much to their surprise.\nIn exchange for her help, Koyomi listened to Gaen's three requests. After Koyomi accepts, Gaen shows the darkness' true motive - it is a manifestation of the natural order, and means to destroy apparitions not behaving as they should—in this case, not Shinobu, but Mayoi. She exposes Mayoi as a \"ghost of a ghost\", who should have passed on on Mother's Day, when she finally found her way home; she also stopped leading people astray, neglecting her duty as a lost cow.\nGaen leaves to allow Koyomi and Mayoi to process this, and Mayoi realizes she has to pass on, rather than be eaten by the darkness. Bidding Koyomi farewell, she kisses him and confesses her love for him before vanishing. Four months later, Koyomi tells the story of the incident to only one person - Ougi Oshino. On his way home, he realizes he never told Mayoi one thing he should have said - goodbye."},"#Koyomi_Dead":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomimonogatari"],"text":"Mayoi reunites with Koyomi after she was supposedly going to the afterlife in Shinobu Time.

After Tadatsuru explains why they were forced to send Koyomi to Hell, they instruct him to hold onto the rope sent by Izuko to return to the living world. However, as Koyomi is about to set off, he realizes how unfair it was to Hachikuji to resurrect before her, thus causing him to reach out and grab her with his legs. As they ascend Hachikuji loses consciousness and only awakens after they arrive, where Izuko approves of her resurrection as she has uses for her in her plan to stop their enemy."},"#Ougi_Dark":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/North_Shirahebi_Shrine","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nadeko_Sengoku"],"text":"During the discussion of Izuko's plan, a new god must take over at North Shirahebi Shrine after to what Nadeko Sengoku did to the shrine.

According to Izuko, Mayoi's options left for her is to be swallowed by the Darkness, go back to hell, or transform herself into a goddess that would allow her to exist as long as she manages the town's bad energy.\nIzuko explains that Mayoi is capable due to the Three-Way deadlock, a precursor to Rock-Paper-Scissors where the snake is beaten by the slug, which is close enough to Mayoi's Lost Snail. If Mayoi becomes the new goddess, she won't lose control like Nadeko did, because she'll beat the old god in any way. Due to this, Mayoi will no longer be swallowed by the Darkness. Mayoi is positive for her promotion since she can still play with Koyomi after all of this.\nOn the way to graduation, Koyomi meets Mayoi. She refuses to greet him since it is inappropriate for a goddess, so he decided to leave.

Among those people who could see and interact with her, she became the closest with Koyomi.\nThe relationship between Koyomi and Mayoi is rather dysfunctional, as Koyomi makes a habit out of molesting her while Mayoi responds by biting him. However, behind the banter and unusual exchanges are close friends that usually spend time talking about things that they are unable to confide with other people, like Koyomi's issue with his sisters making contact with the supernatural, and Mayoi's situation with her family. This friendship eventually reaches a point where Mayoi stops becoming the lost cow just to accompany Koyomi better and Koyomi could willingly give up on his relationship with Hitagi in order to prevent Mayoi from passing on.\nOnly Hitagi was able to deduce the presence of Mayoi despite not being able to see her.

However Ononoki is interested in the theme of humanity's inability to fully control developing technology. She wonders why humans can never have full mastery of their own creations, those creations can lead to humanity's demise. She even draws parallels with the relationship between Araragi and Shinobu. Frustrated, Shinobu argues that the relationship between Ononoki and Kagenui isn't much different. Shinobu then wonders what would happen if those tools invented by humanity had free will. Will those tools desire to be used by humans? Will they want to be used by someone who has full mastery of those tools? Ononoki refutes that such a question is meaningless, since a creation that has free will is a fantasy, which is no longer science fiction. She states that in fact, someone who has full mastery of any tool, a dominator, is also a fantasy. Ononoki suggests that the tool can have more superior ability than its user/master. Shinobu remembers that robots are opressed by humans in I, Robot, because of the fear of rebellion by the robots. She wonders if Ononoki has consciousness, and whether Ononoki desires to be used by Kagenui. Ononoki thinks that being a master must be hard work since he is responsible for controlling something that is stronger than he is, and he might eventually get tired of this burden. This leads Ononoki to conclude that perhaps not having perfect mastery of one's own creation is inevitable. This may lead to humanity's own extinction, and only humanity's inventions will survive in the end.

When people were expecting him to write comedy, Milne wrote The Red House Mystery, a murder mystery. When that became popular, he started writing Winnie-the-Pooh. Senjougahara suggests that it may be human nature to lose motivation after being told what to do.

See Story Timeline for specific story information.\nThe Monogatari Series consists of a many installments that were released slightly differently between adaptations. In all adaptations, the installments don't follow a completely chronological narrative in relation to each other, using methods of non-linear storytelling. There are six main seasons in which the books/anime adaptations are organized: First Season, Second Season, Final Season, Off Season, Monster Season, and Family Season. Each season has its own \"monogatari\" installments, and each installment has its own arcs, usually ranging from 1 - 7 arcs per installment. \nFirst Season consists of the books/anime cours: Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari, along with Nekomonogatari Black. Kizumonogatari, originally the second released book of the light novel series, was announced as a film adaptation in 2012 but was put on a hiatus up until it was to revealed to be released as a trilogy of films starting in January 2016 and finishing a year later. \nSecond Season consists of five stories total being Nekomonogatari White, Kabukimonogatari, Hanamonogatari, Otorimonogatari, Onimonogatari, and Koimonogatari. While First Season consists of two books with two volumes and another two books with only one volume each, Second Season consists of only one volume, one arc books. The anime adaptation, Monogatari Series Second Season consisted of all five books during its TV broadcast except for Hanamonogatari which was later released separately. \nFinal Season consists of Tsukimonogatari, Koyomimonogatari, Owarimonogatari, and lastly Zoku Owarimonogatari. This Season concludes the first major story arc in the series, but is not actually the true \"Final Season\" as the name would suggest. The Final Season anime adaptations consisted of a single arc book adaptation with Tsukimonogatari, a compilation adaptation with Owarimonogatari containing its first two volumes, an ONA series adaptation of Koyomimonogatari that was distributed on an app of the same name in Japan, the adaptation of the third and final volume of Owarimonogatari that released as a two day special, and Zoku Owarimonogatari, which screened in Japanese theaters as a special, having a six episode TV broadcast version released the following year. Due to the time of release, the Kizumonogatari trilogy of films could also in a way be considered associated with the Final Season anime adaptations, though Kizumonogatari as a whole is officially grouped with First Season as with the light novel series. \nOff Season consists of additional stories that occur after Final Season and throughout the series timeline with Orokamonogatari, Wazamonogatari, Nademonogatari, and Musubimonogatari. Most of these stories fill in the gaps and set up the next season.  \nMonster Season consists of even more stories with Shinobumonogatari , Yoimonogatari, Amarimonogatari, Ougimonogatari, and Shinomonogatari. An anime adaptation of both Off Season and Monster Season has been confirmed to be in production in 2024.  \nFamily Season currently consists of Ikusamonogatari and Tsugimonogatari. It appears to be a continuation of the events set up in Musubimonogatari, the original end of the timeline. \nA multitude of short stories have also been released, though it seems unlikely they will be adapted into anime. \nOnly the books from Bakemonogatari to Zoku Owarimonogatari have officially been released in English so far, and only a handful of parts of the series are fully fan-translated online. Many sites remove their translations after the official release. \nA Bakemonogatari manga adaptation began serialization in 2018.

Unlike the anime release order, which many argue were especially related to production complications, all shuffles in chronological placement are fully intentional for the narrative, making certain plot points related to Kizumonogatari more coherent.

The argument for this order is often placed more on the author's intent and themes between the meta-narrative.   \nThis order is especially reasonable for first time reading, as the characters often make a lot more explicit, fourth-wall breaking jokes and references within the monologue that assume you've probably read them this way, as well as author's notes that are generally written around the original release context.   \nNote that if you watch in this order, you would normally watch Hanamonogatari in between Second Season after the 10th episode."},"#First_Season":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Second_Season":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Final_Season":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Off_Season":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Monster_Season":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Family_Season":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Anime_Release_/_SHAFT_Order":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Shaft","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tatsuya_Oishi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_List"],"text":"Go to this route if you want to experience the series as people did when it first came out as an anime, like the idea of experiencing an origin story before a finale in mystery story, and or value seeing how the cinematography evolved over the years with each installment of the anime adaptation between different directors, with the trade-off of missing a mostly more coherent, originally intended order by the author.\nFor a long time, this was the rule of thumb order for anime only watchers (and the entire English-speaking community) as it was roughly the only plausible order for each respective group. With studio Shaft temporarily skipping Kizumonogatari and no official English translations for the series arriving until 2015, this is generally how most longtime English speaking and or anime-only fans originally experienced the series (outside of those that might have read a Kizumonogatari fan translation.) \nThe biggest difference with this order is that it has Kizumonogatari, the origin story, as a mysterious missing part of the story to be anticipated later in the series, just before a big finale of the first three seasons. While some don't mind this and enjoy the added mystery element, some argue that it leaves too many unanswered questions that are answered too late in the series and is now made obsolete. From a narrative perspective, it works more as a happy accident than an intentional narrative, so certain plot points around the origin story don't flow as comfortably. Kizumonogatari is also referenced even more explicitly in the novels, meaning it probably doesn't work as well as a reading order.   \nFrom a directorial perspective in the anime series, Kizumonogatari also marks the return of some of the original staff who contributed largely to the unique presentation of Bakemonogatari, but had less involvement with later parts of the series such as director Tatsuya Oishi, composer Satoru Kosaki, and acclaimed animators such as Gen'ichirou Abe and Ryo Imamura, making their return arguably feel more significant when experienced later with its high animation quality.   \nSome also prefer the placements of Hanamonogatari and Koyomimonogatari, as they feel these parts are comparably more directly relevant to the arcs around them. though as with novel release order, these tend to have less impact on the story compared to Kizumonogatari.     \nThe Episode List page is another helpful resource for this order."},"#First_Season_2":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Second_Season_2":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Final_Season_2":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Off_Season_&_Monster_Season":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Family_Season_2":{"link":[],"text":""},"#English_Light_Novel_Release_Order_/_%22Kizumonogatari_First%22_Order":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Chronological_Order":{"link":[],"text":"This order eliminates most meta narrative elements in favor of a mostly linear, continuous story.

Certain key chronological material also has yet to be adapted or officially translated. \nNote that the Koyomimonogatari arcs are mostly rough estimates as most seem to take place either during or in between certain arcs and anime series episodes, making it hard to fit them in a linear list. \nThe following references the western releases for volume numbers."},"#Visual_Graphic":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Hybrid_Order":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Important_Streaming/Blu-ray_Information":{"link":[],"text":""},"#See_Also":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Musubimonogatari","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Musubimonogatari","toc":[{"#Publisher's_Summary":["#Teaser","#Official_Summary"]},"#Etymology","#Introduced_Characters",{"#Plot":["#Zenka_Mermaid","#Nozomi_Golem","#Mitome_Wolf","#Tsuzura_Human"]},"#Illustrations"],"Description":"Musubimonogatari (結物語) is the seventeenth part of the Monogatari Series.

Eating mermaid flesh saved her and made her immortal, but in exchange when she gets wet her body turns into a fish, so she had to give up on her dreams. Not like the typical \"little mermaid\" mermaid, with a pretty fish tail, but full on mostly fish creature like a sahagin or something.\nThis makes life extremely difficult for her, since she essentially has to avoid water. Washing her hands turn them into fins, she can't ever go outside when it's raining, etc. The amount, depth, temperature, composition of the water determines what sort of fish she turns into. She has even turned into hyper-creepy-alien deep sea fish before.\nFurthermore, now that HER body is all \"mermaid meat\", it makes her flesh extremely desirable to other kaii/oddities.\nSummary: 5 kids have drowned in the river by Naoetsu High School recently. The serial incident started with one boy being attacked and surviving, but he's still severely injured and unconscious. 3 witnesses to the unconscious boy's attack testify it was like he was 'dragged into the water by invisible hands'.\nKoyomi goes swimming in the river without incident, and so turns to Shinobu for advice, who tells him that the attacks will indeed continue until he deals with the oddity causing them. With Suou using the mermaid flesh of her own body as 'bait', they lure it out. The true form of the \"culprit\" is the soul of the very first victim, the unconscious boy. When he drowned naturally, his soul was assimilated into the river itself and has unintentionally been drowning people while desperately seeking help.\nThe reason the boy's soul didn't react to adults and only \"attacked\" kids was because his parents had badly neglected him and so he didn't trust adults. They're able to draw him out now because they visited his body at the hospital, I believe.\nDuring the climax, the oddity's power prevents Araragi from diving into the river to help. So he has Suou help out by using one of her innate mermaid ability, the \"Mermaid's Song\" which affects \"any and all Humans who are drowning\". Thereby Koyomi is able to grab onto the boy's soul's 'hand' and pull him to safety, resolving the incident.\nNotes of Girls Appearing in the Story:\nKaren: Tsukihi is away overseas and their parents were transferred downtown. She now lives alone with her beloved Oni-chan. She's also a police officer stationed in Naoetsu as part of Public Safety, which occupies her days along with her thriving martial arts. She sucks at housework, but her cooking skills have risen significantly due to her taking care of Araragi's meals when he was in training. She's still growing taller and markedly over 180cm now.\nKanbaru: Araragi meets her when he goes to the hospital to pay a visit to the unconscious drowned boy. Her hair is all the way down to her waist now. Due to her own experiences and what happened in Rouka's past, she's aiming to be a sports doctor. She plays basketball on her day's off with her colleagues. Entering university taught her how narrow her outlook really was. She still meets/talks with Ougi from time to time.\nGaen: Doesn't appear personally, but does in reminiscences. Her idea is to take \"the practices of the specialists behind the scenes and create a public organization to do the same work.\" So she collected/scouted people who had experiences with oddities in one place and set up shop.\nShinobu: The same as always, appearance and personality. The one difference is that in the past she always wore that sheer one-piece dress, but now she alters her 'costume' to mirror whatever Koyomi's wearing. If he's in a winter coat, so is she, if he's in a swimsuit, so is she, etc. Araragi regrets how things turned out when he over-utilized her powers so much in the past, so he's taken a hard-line stance that he can have her help out with advice and whatnot, but not cooperating like in the past."},"#Nozomi_Golem":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nozomi_Kizashima","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Naoetsu_Private_High_School"],"text":"Koyomi and a  named Nozomi Kizashima investigate a case regarding a kamaitachi attacking people at Naoetsu Private High School.\nKizashima Nozomi, 29 years old. Police inspector, and golem. She looks like a petite, baby-faced woman, but in truth she died of an illness when she was an elementary schooler. However, her grandparents delved into forbidden arts and affixed her soul to a clay doll, reviving her.\nIn the years after, her grandparents would adjust and \"age\" the clay body as needed to suit what her proper appearance should be, but then they died when she was in middle school. Since she presumably doesn't know the magic, she hasn't been able to alter her body and has remained in her current form ever since.\nShe has no idea how long her soul can stay affixed to her clay body, but in essence she's immortal. Likewise, she has no sense of pain whatsoever. However, since she is made of clay/mud, she will begin to crack when dry, so she always carries water with her (kind of the opposite counterpart to Zenka). Her personality/speech patterns resemble Mayoi a bit.\nSummary: There's a \"Serial Slasher Incident\" going on as students coming home from Naoetsu high are having their backs slashed up, although only their uniforms (no bodily harm). None of the victims have any idea when they got slashed. Araragi and Nozomi go to investigate his alma mater together in case it's a kamaitachi (sickle weasel) or the like.\nAraragi consults with Ougi, who still resides within the non-existent class 1-3 at the school, and comes to the realization that the majority of students being slashed are on the way HOME from school, not those coming TO school, so he and Nozomi take to watching over the students.\nKoyomi's perched across from the convex road mirror. Nozomi can dowse herself with water and turn completely into a flow of living mud, which can assimilate with the earth around her for camouflage. But nothing happens. From Ougi's hints, Araragi guesses that the students on their way home from school only coincidentally realized that their uniform's backs had been damaged because they saw them in the reflection from the street corner safety mirrors. The actual 'scene of the crime' was AT school, when the uniforms were changed for gym, which is why \"only the clothes got slashed, and not the people in them\". So just a human crime.\nNotes of Girls Appearing in the Story:\nSpooky Ougi: Has become one of the 7 mysteries of the school, along with the classroom. She leads people who are going astray even further. Her outer appearance hasn't changed, but her personality on the inside has dramatically changed, according to Araragi: she's ended up completely unmanageable/uncontrollable/spoiled. However, he surmises that she's the one who actually ended the case within the school so that the damages to uniforms stopped occurring.\nNadeko:\nHas already left the city as of the events of Musubi. Has helped Gaen out as detailed in Nademonogatari, and has debuted as a mangaka under the pen name Sengoku Nadeshiko. She's got three serialized works, although Ougi says they're not very popular. However, she adds that, though they're cute they've got an underlying darkness in them that gives them cult popularity status."},"#Mitome_Wolf":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Mitome_Saisaki","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsubasa_Hanekawa"],"text":"A  named Mitome Saisaki discusses Tsubasa Hanekawa after having been her bodyguard.\nSaisaki Mitome: 29 years old, police inspector, descendant of werewolves.\nThough she comes from a long bloodline of lycanthropes, she differs in that she was not born inherently an oddity/monster. Additionally the way of the wolf is strong with her, and she can transform into wolf form not just from seeing the full moon, but by looking at any round object. Conversely, even under the most powerful of moons she can resist the transformation.\nWhile she has quite high physical skills, that's by human standards and she's not altogether inhumanly strong or fast.\nWhile she's got a rough personality and gruff manner of speaking, she carries an absolute conviction in completing any mission she's given. She was actually originally hoping to be a police dog when she aimed for the police force. It's for her mental strength, not her physical strength, that Gaen values her. By the age of 23 she was already commanding her own troops in emergency disaster relief and large-scale criminal investigations.\nHanekawa Tsubasa (written in katakana, unlike the usual kanji):\nThe same woman we knew, but it's more appropriate to call her \"a true bakemono\" these days, hence the katakana. As detailed in Wazamonogatari, she traveled the world with Dramaturgy, and it wouldn't be wrong to literally say \"she toured around every and any country in the world, and travelled to them all\".\nAfter conducting various peace-keeping activities such as landmine removal, she has become an international celebrity and is renowned as the \"Japanese Jeanne D'Arc\". Since the age of 20 she goes around, not advocating or acting on behalf of the victims of war, but as a 'war mediator' in the interest of halting War itself. She has brought countless wars to an end around the world as she brokers peace treaties.\nHowever, as an extreme pacifist who is as close as possible to believing in and pushing her ideology of \"erasing all the borders between countries of the world\", she already is seen as walking the edge of the knife blade of desiring world conquest herself. She is therefore treated now as an international wanted criminal offender by every nation in the world. ::A lot of people seem to comment that Hanekawa seems the most changed by the 5 years, and that her premise is crazy::\nSummary: Hanakawa Tsubasa has become an internationally wanted person of interest, and so she has returned to her home country of Japan in order to completely eliminate all traces of her past presence. Mitome, who's been appointed in charge of Hanekawa's guard, goes to talk to Ararararagi and ask him about Tsubasa since he knows her.\nMitome asks him, \"During her stay, do you think Hanekawa will come see you?\" to which Araragi responds, \"You don't need to worry about that.\" He returns home to find that Tsukihi has come back from overseas. He thinks he's going to settle down to a nice meal with both his sisters for the first time in a while, only to find that Hanekawa is already there and staying over.\nAfter dinner, the two of them are washing dishes together when Hanekawa tells him, \"I came back here just to see you, Araragi.\" \"Why would you do a thing like that,\" asks Araragi, as well as, \"How did you escape your heavily guarded hotel?\" \"If you can see through that trick,\" she replies, \"Then I'll answer your other question.\" After the short conversation, and after leaving the Araragi house, he reports to Mitome.\nAraragi concludes that the trick she used was sending an exact body double she'd found whilst traveling the world to his home. Furthermore, he concludes, the real reason 'Hanekawa' came to the Araragi household was to reclaim, from his room, the panties he'd gotten from her in the past \"in order to erase all traces of her past existence\" as she'd intended. However, Mitome responds with, \"The possibility exists that I could have been guarding the body double, while the real one might have been the one who came to see you.\"\nDespite pointing that out, Koyomi insists there's absolutely no way that's true. Because, as their positions in the world stand now, he's just an inconsequential man to her. But whether that makes him happy or not...\nNotes of Girls Appearing in the Story:\nTsukihi:\nDropped out of college twice, now studying dance overseas. Her current plan is to end up as a casino dancer. Her current hairstyle is just like original Hanekawa, twin-tail thick braids. Seems like she's still in touch with Nadeko."},"#Tsuzura_Human":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsuzura_Kouga"],"text":"A story related to Tsuzura Kouga, the human chief of the department.\nKouga Tsuzura: Section Chief of the Hearsay Department. Only pure Human among the members there. Valued by Gaen for her great skill at communicating with people, and because she wanted someone with absolutely no spirit senses to command the department so as never to be influenced by oddities.\nShe values Araragi's abilities, and has told him she wishes him to take over as chief of the Hearsay department some day. However, she doesn't believe he necessarily lives his life in an ideal manner, and has told him to could live a bit more relaxed/comfortably if he wanted. \nOikura Sodachi:\nShe is qualified as an accountant while studying abroad, and currently works as a local civil servant at Naoetsu City Hall. She chose that location because she was indebted to the woman in charge of her social welfare there when she was a student. She took out a civil servant loan and purchased the same abandoned house where she and Ararararagi met as kids to study math, and now lives there. She is the picture of a civil servant, her hair tightly done up and she has become a meganekko.\nAfter graduating from high school, at Hanekawa's prompting, Sodachi takes the entrance exam to a certain university's math program, and there, she reunites with Araragi. She has trouble finding a dorm/boarding house to live in. After Araragi consults his parents, they instructed him to let her live at home with him (paralleling her living there when she was a kid). However, this does not bode well with Senjougahara, who breaks up with him. Oikura immediately leaves the house and then helps the two get back together. She threatens that if they all don't try to have Senjougahara and Araragi make up and get back together, she'll jump off a building and commit suicide. \nFor a while the three of them enjoy a normal college lifestyle together, but after Araragi breaks up with Senjougahara for the second time over some stupid, worthless reasons Sodachi is so angry at him that she 'permanently' cut off any relation with him forever for the 4th time. Even after reuniting with Araragi, her sharp tongue and pretending to hate him don't change. She later shares her inner thoughts by commenting, \"Go chase after Hitagi overseas, and afterward suffer some catastrophe and be lost by the roadside somewhere!\" Now and then, she would give Araragi advice about the breakups, and afterwards would exchange phone numbers and rescind 'cutting off their friendship forever' again.\nSummary:\nAlthough Araragi and Hitagi had broken up twice before, when she begins officially working as a manager at her finance firm it causes strife and they have a huge fight over the phone. By the time it is over, they'd broken up for the 3rd time. Sometime afterwards, he is submitting some documents at town hall when he runs into Sodachi. As he is attacked by her barbed tongue like usual, she eventually gives him some advice about dating Gahara-san and their future together as he wonders what he wants to do.\nKoyomi decides to head for the North White Snake Shrine, which he admits he has been avoiding for awhile because he fears his adult self wouldn't be able to see Mayoi anymore. He resolves, \"I am going to hold my wedding ceremony to Hitagi there\".\nSeeking Shinobu's cooperation, he asks her to prepare a survey report on oddity activity in the city center, and then goes to ask Section Chief Kouga to recommend him for overseas training. Additionally, he presents that, \"Since Shinobu is with me, we can act as interpreters for foreign oddities\". He is willing to do anything and everything to be with Hitagi.\nUpon receiving his endorsement and returning home, he finds Hitagi there waiting for him. She convinces her company to open a Japanese branch so that she can move back and live together with him again. They both were thinking the same thing and working on it from both sides. They make up and have a reversal of the scene at the end of Mayoi Snail where Araragi goes \"I rab you\" in broken English, and Hitagi goes \"Koyomi fascination/tore\". The indication is that he will ask her to marry him soon."},"#Illustrations":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Mōsō Express","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/M%C5%8Ds%C5%8D_Express","toc":["#Background","#Lyrics","#Video","#Trivia"],"Description":"Mōsō♡Express (もうそう♡えくすぷれす, lit. \"Delusion♡Express\") is the third opening theme song of Monogatari Series Second Season, played during the Nadeko Medusa story (Episodes 12 and 14 for the TV broadcast and Episodes 10 and 12 for the disc releases).

Tsukihi curses Koyomi for sleeping just after being waken up by her and her older sister Karen. Fortunately though, Koyomi manages to avoid the attack, and Tsukihi was just trying out being a yandere for a moment, much to Koyomi's fright.\nSoon, Koyomi realizes that it is Golden Week (more specifically, less than 9 hours have passed in Golden Week's first day), and he is very much pessimistic about it, to Tsukihi's disappointment.\nThen, Koyomi decides to open a conversation with Tsukihi about that complicated thing called love.\n\nKoyomi decides to open the topic since he knows that Tsukihi is a \"veteran\" when it comes to love, as she already has a boyfriend and her classmates probably ask her for love advice as well. He tells Tsukihi that he has feelings for a girl in his class. Tsukihi is very shocked about this declaration, since she knew that Koyomi is the type of person who sees friends as weakness. However, Koyomi clarifies that it is just a possibility, and he is not sure himself.\nThen, Koyomi throws his first question at Tsukihi: \"How does one figure out if they're in love with a member of the opposite sex?\"\nTsukihi is rather anooyed by her brother's dumbness when it comes to love and drives a fist up Koyomi's torso before ordering him to kneel in front of her. Then, she demands a deeper explanation from Koyomi. Koyomi soon tells Tsukihi that he is head over heels with a certain Miss H, who ended up in the same class as his only recently. He admits that he cannot stop looking at her even during class, and he even arrives at a point wherein he wonders if his actions would be good in Miss H's eyes.\nTsukihi stops Koyomi from giving too much information, and confirms that it might actually be love that he was feeling, although Koyomi is still not sure himself.\n\nKoyomi then decides to ask Tsukihi the same question, but applying her experiences with her boyfriend Rousokuzawa instead. Tsukihi's answer was rather vague, telling Koyomi that she knew that it was love \"somehow\", and left it as is, with no further details about how exactly she knew that Rousokuzawa was falling in love with her.\nTsukihi then explains that love is something that cannot be explained well in words, and those reasons that a person might give to love a person — whether it is looks, personality or anything else — are simply lies created to justify one's feelings. She then adds that love can be as simple as the urge to be with someone.\nKoyomi finally says that he might have fallen in love with Miss H for good, but Tsukihi is not contented with it. She proclaims that her brother has fallen in love with Miss H, and tells Koyomi to strengthen his decision.\nKoyomi thanks Tsukihi for her advice, and she responds by reminding Koyomi that love is simple, and is not something to worry about. She also confirms that it is also normal for him to think of her all the time, to focus on her more than the blackboard, and thinking dirty thoughts about her.\nHowever, having the urge to grope her breasts isn't.\nEven if it is a pair of breasts that is appealing enough to be felt even a bit. That is not love, Tsukihi says, and she tells him that a boy wanting a cop a feel on a girl's breasts is natural and is completely unrelated to feelings of love.\nThen, after a moment of thought, Tsukihi decides to let Koyomi try it out.\nWithout a word. Without any expression. Without thinking, I touched her without any further ado.\nTsukihi leaped back in shock as Koyomi quickly cups her breasts with each hand. Tightly. For a moment, Koyomi's hands clamp on Tsukihi's breasts like a vise and after some tackling, Koyomi frees his hands. Although a bit startled by what just happened, she explains that it was a quick test, and based on the outcome, she concludes that Koyomi might be sexually frustrated, deluding himself that \"feelings of love\" and \"urges of libido\" are one and the same.\nKoyomi accepts his current status and decides to come up with countermeasures, and the first idea in his head was using his two sisters' breasts to avoid groping Miss H's. Of course, Tsukihi refused to let her breasts be touched for that reason, and instead suggests that Koyomi should buy an adult-rated magazine, something that Koyomi himself has been avoiding to do probably due to keep himself from being judged by Miss H, contributing to his pent-up frustration. Tsukihi soon urges Koyomi to buy it as soon as possible, so Koyomi changes his clothes and plans to head out to the local bookstore.\n\nOn his way out, he saw his younger sister Karen, who was drenched in so much sweat that Koyomi thought that it was raining outside. Karen tells Koyomi that she just returned from a round of jogging (which is as long as a full marathon, or 42.195 km long), and is taking the chance to go out since it is a fine sunny day outside.\nShe heads to the kitchen to get some water, and proceeds to strip afterwards. Meanwhile, Koyomi decides to ask Karen about what she thinks about how a person can determine if a person is in love, the same question that he asked to Tsukihi earlier.\nKaren's answer is rather straightforward: \"If looking at their face makes you want to have their babies, you're in love with them. It's that simple.\"\n\nKoyomi rides a bicycle for a quick trip to the local bookstore. On his way though, he sees a familiar face... Tsubasa Hanekawa, his classmate, wearing her school uniform. Although they exchanged an energetic yet simple hi and hello to each other, Koyomi spices things up by flipping Tsubasa's skirt, causing the startled girl to slap him in the face. As Koyomi falls to the ground, however, he catches a glimpse of Tsubasa's rather interesting choice of underwear. Although surprised by Koyomi's immature move, Tsubasa helps him up and praises him for his kindness.\nThen, she invites him for a walk across town.\nTsubasa mentions about Koyomi's sisters, and Koyomi proceeds to rant about them for causing trouble, although he acknowledges the fact that there are times where Koyomi himself started the trouble in the first place, and tells her that nothing much will change if he doesn't have siblings. Tsubasa remarks that they are in the same boat, and even adds that she does not have a family to begin with. Koyomi is a bit alarmed by Tsubasa's statement, but Tsubasa even repeated the same statement, even telling him that she doesn't have any relatives.\nAs they continue their walk, Tsubasa tells Koyomi that her real parents have long since died, and she lives with two strangers called stepparents at home. With a smile, she laments at her unfortunate fate of not having any family to cherish, and has long since abandoned the hope of having a family out of those not blood-related.\nKoyomi then asks about the bruise that is now covered by a large bandage on her left cheek. Tsubasa wonders why someone like him would ask that kind of question, and Koyomi responds by saying that he is a friend, although he is personally not sure about it. Tsubasa reluctantly accepts Koyomi's friendly gesture, but tells him to keep it a secret to anyone, even to his family. Koyomi promptly affirms.\n\nTsubasa then finally tells what happened to her left cheek: she was hit by his stepfather, who probably lost his temper after talking to someone who is completely unfamiliar to him. She blames himself for trying so hard to be close to a stranger like him. Koyomi feels uncomfortable at Tsubasa's words, who appear to be protecting her father rather than herself. At that moment, Koyomi, despite declaring his friendship for Tsubasa, finds her actions revolting.\nTsubasa did not answer Koyomi's protests against her father and instead confirms if Koyomi promises to keep this a secret. Koyomi, in response, admits that he cannot let this fact stay in the shadows for long. Tsubasa then pleads to Koyomi, telling him that she is willing to do anything to keep him from breaking his promise.\nSuddenly, Koyomi becomes excited about the \"willing to do anything\" part, but soon finds himself unable to think of the best thing to ask Tsubasa to do. Soon, his excitement narrows his mind to the point of throwing away the discussion that passed and even his name to the trash, and his mind only revolves around \"that thing that he wants Tsubasa to do\", much to Tsubasa's disappointment.\nAs Tsubasa tried to sort out Koyomi's rather erratic actions, Koyomi asks her to go with him to the nearby bushes; Tsubasa complies, although she is a bit ancious herself. There, he proceeds to think even more, at times looking closely at Tsubasa as if boring a hole through her.\n\nThen, Koyomi finally decides on Tsubasa's next move.\nAs Koyomi lets out his tongue, he asks Tsubasa to let him lick a hole through her bruised left cheek.\n\nDue to his vampire blood, Koyomi's blood is all it takes to heal Tsubasa's bruised cheek, and he ended up abandoning the licking part due to being a scaredy cat. Although grateful about what Koyomi had done, Tsubasa remains melancholy, knowing that her completely-healed bruise, or anything that would happen to her in general, would simply be left unnoticed by her stepparents. In fact, Tsubasa even thinks that her stepparents do not even remember her face.\nKoyomi heads straight back home immediately after that. His excitement has been doused by depression caused by listening to Tsubasa's sad story, and he even forgot to but some adult magazines for him.\nHe just goes straight to the comfort room, where he realizes the weight of his feelings burdening him at the moment."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Trivia":{"link":["https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbakemonogatari.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FNekomonogatari_Black_Episode_01%3A_Tsubasa_Family%2C_Part_1%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D6&uselang=en"],"text":"Quotes[]"},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Nekomonogatari Black Episode 02: Tsubasa Family, Part 2","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nekomonogatari_Black_Episode_02:_Tsubasa_Family,_Part_2","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Tsubasa Family, Part 2\" ( つばさファミリー 其ノ貳, Tsubasa Famirii Sono Ni) is the second episode of the Nekomogatari Black anime series. It continues the Tsubasa Family story, which focuses on the events after Koyomi's transformation into a vampire in Kizumonogatari, particularly Tsubasa's encounter with the oddity that contributed to the appearance of Black Hanekawa. It was released on December 31, 2012.\nThe day after spending much of his time with a new friend, Koyomi visits the unlikely home of the eccentric Meme Oshino following Tsubasa Hanekawa 's contact with an oddity called a sawarineko. Despite the risks involved in facing an oddity, Koyomi pushes through with his part of the plan in trying to sort out Tsubasa's case, but will soon find himself in a dangerous situation with a surprisingly powerful foe.","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Mister_Donut"],"text":"The night of the 30th of April.  \nThat night, Koyomi visits the abandoned cram school building carrying stuff straight from the convenience store . Inside, he sees a young girl with golden hair sitting in one corner. It turns out that he is there to give the mysterious girl, who will be named Shinobu Oshino, his blood to sustain herself. Although she glares coldly at him, Koyomi smiles and tells her to do the same before approching her to make his neck accessible to the young vampire.\nKoyomi, however, is surprised when Shinobu pauses and her body moves towards his back, as if reaching for the bag of groceries behind him. He thinks that a powerful vampire — or rather a remnant of one — has no chance of getting an indulgence to donuts, but Shinobu stubbornly tries to get more of the donuts after getting one. Fortunately, those donuts appear to have made her easy to tame. However, Koyomi has to save the other donuts for Meme, whom the donuts are for, so he decided to keep it to himself for the meantime.\nBut Shinobu's sullen expression weighs down on him, as if reminding him that it was his fault that she is forced to live a lifestyle like she is living right now. Although Koyomi is supposed to not feel any compassion towards her, his heart eventually gives in. After handing over the box of donuts to Shinobu, the young vampire tears it open and proceeds to indulge herself.\n\nSoon, Meme Oshino, the person who was supposed to eat those donuts, arrives, telling Koyomi to stop bullying Shinobu, although that isn't the case. Koyomi soon notices that Shinobu has been acting with less maturity than before, and Meme explains that it is probably due to the fact that oddities are built from the beliefs of humans; that is, Shinobu changed because of human intervention... and since of all the people who know of her existence, Meme suspects that Koyomi himself was the reason for her mental regression.\nKoyomi acknowledges the possibility that he caused Shinobu to act younger than what she truly is, but he doesn't accept that the Shinobu who is eating her donuts like a dog is the kind of Shinobu that he imagines her to be. Meme points out, however, that direct influence doesn't always yield an expected effect, and there are other factors to consider as well, particularly the \"parent's hope\"... what someone wishes for his/her child. The term suddenly reminds Koyomi of Tsubasa for a moment, then he realizes that he has to be a bit more responsible for his actions, especially since Meme warns him that making the wrong decisions with oddities involved may spell bad news.\n\nMeme soon shifts the topic to Tsubasa Hanekawa and asks about how she is doing. Koyomi's lack of an answer worries Meme a bit, since he assumes that this means that whatever happened to Tsubasa is something that he can't talk to her. Regardless, Meme pushes Koyomi to divulge whatever he can, knowing that nothing forbids him from talking about Tsubasa.\nKoyomi decides to tell what he can... that is, telling the events of the day before, omitting certain details that cannot be said. He covers his first moments of the day, his conversations with his sister Tsukihi and classmate Tsubasa, and the event that happened right after that.\nTsubasa picks up a dead white cat on the road.\nMeme then asks if this dead cat is a silver one without a tail.\nKoyomi affirms it.\n\nMeme then reveals that it is a sawarineko, one of the oddities that he has been looking for. An oddity that resembles the domestic cat. He soon adds that by itself, the sawarineko is not a risk, but the factor that is Tsubasa Hanekawa makes it a dangerous one. Meme explains that the burial of a sawarineko can be seen as a normal activity, but adding Tsubasa to the equation was able to transform that normal scene into an earth-shattering one.\nMeme tells Koyomi that the only way to resolve this issue is to split up; Meme will exhume the remains of the sawarineko (which requires Koyomi to tell where it was buried), while Koyomi will handle the more difficult half of the plan: to visit Tsubasa directly talk to her, and watch closely at her eyes.\n\nKoyomi takes off by bike and heads to the direction of Tsubasa's house. However, before reaching the house, he sees a peculiar silhouette in the distance. Initially, Koyomi doubts that it was Tsubasa based on the silhouette itself. However, upon seeing the same underwear Tsubasa was wearing the day before on the figure in the distance, Koyomi quickly tails what he thinks is Tsubasa.\nSoon, Koyomi comes face to face with what appears to be Tsubasa, but with silvery-white hair, cat ears, and wearing nothing but black underwear. The silvery-white Tsubasa soon speaks at Koyomi, whom she calls \"her master's friend\", and then hurls two bodies at him. To Koyomi's shock, those were the unconscious bodies of Tsubasa's stepparents.\nThe Tsubasa with silvery-white hair soon prepares to leave, requesting Koyomi to dispose of the bodies any way he could, but Koyomi ignores this. Suddenly, the playful silver cat changes her mood and lunges at Koyomi, pointing out that it was him who is responsible for the suffering of \"her master\". The silvery-white cat bites down on Koyomi's left arm and tears it right apart, and the sensation of pain quickly rips through Koyomi's body.\nAs Koyomi is pinned down at the head by the cat's heavy foot, she tells Koyomi that her master no longer needs him anymore. Meanwhile, Koyomi realizes that the \"master\" this cat is telling about is none other than Tsubasa herself, and the one who just stained the streets with his blood is none other than the oddity that Tsubasa encountered the day before.\nSoon, the oddity tells Koyomi that Tsubasa no longer needs anyone — friends, family, or even herself — and that she will give her the freedom that no one else can give for her... and the first step to achieving that is getting rid of her stress. After that, she disappeared.\n\nKoyomi picks up his torn arm and tries to sort things out as his vampire powers of regeneration kick in. He then calls for the ambulance to take Tsubasa's parents to a nearby hospital, while he no longer needed to do anything about the bloodbath that happened earlier, since all of his blood quickly evaporated before he could do anything.\nHowever, he notices that his blood fizzles out slower than he expected, and with one arm, he drives his way back to Meme's place.\n\nKoyomi wakes up in the late afternoon the next day. Meme already has an idea about what happened, and remarks that their worst fear has come true. Fortunately, Koyomi is close to fully recovering, thanks to Shinobu boosting his regenerative ability by her mere presence. Koyomi soon tells Meme about his slower regeneration ability despite being bitten by Shinobu not long before what happened, and Meme just tells him that \"he simply picked the wrong opponent\".\nEspecially if said opponent can overpower Koyomi's immortality just by her touch, not to mention their ability to drain a target's energy, although not to the degree of a vampire's similar ability.\nMeme soon reminds Koyomi to be careful with fighting against the sawarineko, since it is not in the match between a vampire, the strongest oddity known, and a much weaker sawarineko, but between a human with oddity blood and a real oddity, which Koyomi is a former at the end of the day. He also adds that his search for the cat corpse came up empty, complicating things even further for them.\nMeme decides to call it a day to give Koyomi ample time to rest his torn arm and also reminds him to give thanks to Shinobu for her efforts. Koyomi still thinks that Shinobu only treats him like some source of nutrition, and Meme thinks that Koyomi is a thick-headed idiot for being too harsh on her.\nHe also reminds Koyomi that he has to come home immediately, as he has heard Koyomi's phone vibrate like crazy.\n\nKoyomi continues to point out his responsibility for Tsubasa, but Meme takes responsibility for what happened to her, and doesn't want him — who aside from being a part-oddity is a human and a minor — to be gravely injured for his lapses in judgment.\nMeme then tells Koyomi that he will be put off of the hook in Tsubasa's case indefinitely, and that he will no longer be allowed to take action."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Nekomonogatari Black Episode 03: Tsubasa Family, Part 3","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nekomonogatari_Black_Episode_03:_Tsubasa_Family,_Part_3","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"Tsubasa Family, Part 3\" is the third episode of the Nekomogatari Black anime series.

It was released on December 31, 2012.\nKoyomi's mind goes on a roller-coaster ride as he grasps more of Tsubasa's complicated life, while Meme goes on a losing streak at the hands of the sawarineko. Then, a conversation between Koyomi and the oddity that claims Tsubasa's body clears many things about Tsubasa's hidden side and the intentions of the sawarineko, but it also sows more questions in Koyomi's mind.","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Hanekawa_Residence","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsukihi_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Karen_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Meme_Oshino"],"text":"In the Hanekawa residence, Koyomi takes the chance to sneak in Tsubasa's room after she, in the form of the sawarineko, leaves her house once again. However, upon entering the house through an open window on the second floor, he was overwhelmed with shock, followed with fear so intense that he leapt out of the window and rushes back home, clinging to Tsukihi as soon as he sees her.\nKoyomi just discovered that in the Hanekawa residence, there was not a single room reserved for the girl named Tsubasa Hanekawa.\nAt that moment, Koyomi concludes that Tsubasa and her family is beyond repair.\nTsukihi, concerned about his hysterical brother, decides to offer a kiss to calm him down, but she was swiftly shoved away by the disgusted Koyomi. Tsukihi rants about his brother's utter refusal of her assuring gesture, but soon tells Koyomi that she was rather worried about him as rumors of a bakeneko running loose and attacking people began to spread across town. (It was also the reason for the about 400 missed calls Koyomi had on his phone on the 30th of April.) Of course, Karen and Tsukihi, as the Fire Sisters, are already preparing themselves for some bakeneko hunting.\nKoyomi pretends that he is even more scared now that he has heard Tsukihi's story, so he demands her and Karen sleep with him for the next few days. He does this because he knows it is too dangerous for the Fire Sisters to fight the sawarineko. Tsukihi is easily moved by the look of anxiety in her older brother's face, so she yields to it.\n\nJust as Koyomi asked, the Fire Sisters now share a bed with their older brother. However, Koyomi is still sleepless, thinking of the sawarineko and its objectives. Koyomi finds himself in a dilemma, whether to keep himself from finding out more about Tsubasa and the sawarineko or to delve in deeper, knowing Tsubasa's current situation with her family. For a moment, he wondered what had happened if he just moved away from Tsubasa's problem, but thought that it was cherry picking on his part and was not a good thing to do, considering that Tsubasa did something during Spring break that he had yet to repay.\nKoyomi tried to sleep away from his sisters, but as he curled up on the floor, he feels a degree of regret for his conversation with Tsukihi about love, now that he realizes that he knows little about Tsubasa. Despite this, however, Koyomi still feels like his chest is going to explode every time he thinks about Tsubasa.\n\nAt the first two days of May, Tsubasa never showed up at school, and the rumors of a bakeneko attacking people continue to spread. Koyomi decides to visit Meme.\nAnd to his shock, Koyomi sees Meme badly injured.\nMeme soon reveals that he has fought the sawarineko twenty times over the course of three days, and he lost in every single one of them, blaming it on how distracting the sawarineko looked as they fought (i.e., a girl with large breasts wearing only underwear) and \"losing his touch\".\nHe then mentions something that he did not say before: the sawarineko is a weakling. But it is cunning, faking death, usurping bodies and dragging its victims to the deepest pits of hell. And what makes the sawarineko a very dangerous threat in this case is the fact that it chose to possess Tsubasa Hanekawa, whose knowledge that it shares with the sawarineko makes it a formidable foe for a specialist like Meme... and may perhaps trump even a vampire. Meme admits that he hasn't seen an oddity fight through strategy, and he can't help but commend Tsubasa's brilliant mind helping the sawarineko.\nKoyomi is surprised, as if Meme was suggesting that Tsubasa was actually cooperating with the sawarineko.\nMeme thinks that there is that possibility. However, Meme makes light of his swift defeat in the hands of the sawarineko. It reveals that Tsubasa's consciousness might still be intact despite the sawarineko taking over her body, and otherwise, they would have to kill both Tsubasa and the sawarineko together.\nWhile a bad news in itself, there is still hope, Meme says.\nTheir next step is to try to salvage Tsubasa's consciousness while it is still there and exterminate the sawarineko.\nOf course, there is still the possibility that Tsubasa wasn't really possessed outright by the sawarineko.\n\nThat night, Koyomi offers his blood to Shinobu, he remembers the words Meme told him that afternoon: \"A human being of virtue cannot possibly exist\", \"Kindness is nothing but the tip of the iceberg that is a human being\", \"There is a counterpart. If there be light, then there is darkness; if white, black.\" Meme also adds that people wear facades all the time, with Tsubasa no exception, and it was her habit of insisting that she is virtuous that causes her to build up stress, and eventually unleashes her dark side.\nMeme thinks that Tsubasa, unlike the usual case of a sawarineko, has fused herself, or rather assimilated, with the oddity, creating a formidable opponent. To him, it spells big trouble if they discover that there was no possession to begin with, and tells Koyomi that they should act quickly before a complete merge occurs.\n\nMay 3.\nAlthough there are no classes this day, Koyomi comes to school in his school uniform. Upon arriving at his classroom, Koyomi takes the opportunity and unleashes his lust as he licks the desk where Tsubasa Hanekawa's breasts rest on.\nThen, the sawarineko appears, voicing out its disgust at Koyomi's perverse actions. After Koyomi tries to explain himself to the oddity, the sawarineko notices his lack of hostility towards her, to which Koyomi responds by admitting that he cannot do much against her. However, the sawarineko tells him that it might not be the case vice versa, although it appears that she is not interested in fighting Koyomi, much to his relief. She also mentions that she is rather pleased by the knowledge she had acquired from Tsubasa, and so decides to make an exception to her malicious treatment of her victims.\nKoyomi soon asks for an explanation for the reason why the sawarineko attacks people. The sawarineko tells Koyomi that it acts as a distraction. A stress buster.\nThe sawarineko tells Koyomi that due to her possession abilities, she was able to understand Tsubasa's feelings throughout her fifteen-year stay in the Hanekawa residence and so, helps her cope with his by attacking others to divert her stress... evil and illogical, but not inconsistent.\nShe then assures Koyomi that she will stop after having attacked about 500 people. Until that time comes, she asks Koyomi to tell Meme to stop interfering and leave the helping to her instead.\nKoyomi asks the sawarineko for the reason why she was willing to go this far for Hanekawa, considering that she is simply an evil spirit that should have no reason to help her out. In response, the oddity says that it is simply repaying the debt, even though it is an unthinkable practice for an oddity like her, but aside from thanking Tsubasa for the knowledge she imparted into her, she doesn't feel anything else for her.\n\nShe tells Koyomi Tsubasa's decision to bury the sawarineko that she found lying dead on the road was devoid of pity and emotion and triggered by common sense. Thus, Tsubasa never had kindness to exploit unlike what Koyomi thought.\nThe sawarineko tells Koyomi that Tsubasa longs to be a normal girl, and thus follows a set of laws and formulas that should make her \"normal\", doing those actions without carrying the emotion or virtue that is supposed to come alongside that action. Koyomi tries to justify Tsubasa's actions as her natural instinct kicking in, but the sawarineko adds to his statement, telling him that she will do things without fail, without emotion, without feelings, like a machine.\nShe tells Koyomi that she has never experienced a burial like this in her lifetime, so she feels inclined to save her.\n\nThe sawarineko prepares to leave, but reminds Koyomi of the message he is supposed to pass onto Meme. She then reveals that she has in fact given Meme a chance to live because he is an acquaintance of Tsubasa's, and would have killed him on the first round if she wanted to. As for Koyomi, she knew that he would not do anything.\nKoyomi manages to call the sawarineko before she could leave and tells her that relieveing Tsubasa's stress is an impossible task, as her return to home every day would just cause Tsubasa's stress to come back dspite the sawarineko attacking people. In response, the sawarineko tells Koyomi that she will not give up, and will even perform domestic violence if she desires... anything just to keep them out of her master's house.\nKoyomi, by impulse, rushes to stop her. But the thought of being cursed upon touching her makes him stop in his tracks. The sawarineko thinks that he has made the right decision, and tells him to leave her and her master behind as well.\nShortly after that, the sawarineko disappears.\nKoyomi returns to Tsubasa's seat and feels helpless about Tsubasa's situation. He realizes that he likes Tsubasa so much that he can't bring himself to touch him. Wonder becomes feeling becomes realization.\nHe likes her, but he knows that it is not love that he is feeling.\nRegardless, at that moment, he just wants to die for Tsubasa."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Nekomonogatari Black Episode 04: Tsubasa Family, Part 4","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nekomonogatari_Black_Episode_04:_Tsubasa_Family,_Part_4","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"Tsubasa Family, Part 4\" is the the fourth episode of the Nekomonogatari Black anime series.

However, it comes in the form of Shinobu's foot pressing down on his head for a few moments, followed by a swift kick. As Koyomi staggers to the ground after that, a sword emerges from her mouth: the sword of Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade, the oddity-killer, Kokorowatari. As Koyomi receives the blade from Shinobu, Meme, who emerges shortly after, congratulates him for being able to change Shinobu's mind about handing him the sword.\nMeme then tells Koyomi that Tsubasa's parents have already been discharged from the hospital, and has used the chance to get information about Tsubasa. Although he did not get any important stuff that may be used against the sawarineko, Meme was able to listen to a story that interests him.\nIt was about how Tsubasa's father hit her daughter so hard she flew into the wall.\nAnd her response? With a smile on her face and a wounded cheek, she tells her father that one shouldn't learn to hit girls like that.\nKoyomi and Meme share the same response to hearing that story. They were disgusted. Frightened by Tsubasa's benevolence more than the presence of an oddity.\nMeme soon points out that he is putting himself in the observer's point of view. He neither sides towards Tsubasa's parents nor to Tsubasa herself. To add, no one is right or wrong in this situation. In fact, he almost wanted to commend Tsubasa's parents for being patient in dealing with a girl who is so righteous that it is uncomfortable interacting with her, and whose presence makes people realize one's imperfections. Despite Koyomi's defense towards Tsubasa's actions, Meme points out that Tsubasa has a responsibility to consider the feelings of others as a person with a more brilliant mind than others.\nMeme comes up with the conclusion that anything and everything is to be blamed at Tsubasa. She is the irregularity that has disturbed the regularity of the situation.\n\nKoyomi slowly loses his temper and threatens Meme that he will kill him if he will say more bad things about Tsubasa. Meme asks Koyomi if it was his sympathy talking, but Koyomi clarifies that it was merely his sexual frustration speaking his mind.\nAs the sword that can only hurt oddities called Kokorowatari rests on Koyomi's shoulder, Meme prepares to give him advice on what to do while facing the sawarineko.\nFirst, the Kokorowatari has the ability to separate the sawarineko from Tsubasa without fail, but this means that she can defend against this for the same reason. Meme knows that for every plan they have, Tsubasa has a countermeasure prepared for it, and Koyomi knows this, and hopes that what he is thinking will help in their current situation.\nMeme decides to omit the second warning, although Koyomi has a gist of what he wanted to say to him.\nThen, the last warning is given. He asks Koyomi about how he will look for Tsubasa since there is the possibility of her being somewhere within the town. Koyomi confidently says that he has already figured that one out, and prepares to leave, leaving behind Meme to look for the sawarineko while he does the searching his way.\nMeme decides to leave Koyomi to his decisions, and tells him that no matter the outcome, he shall not be in Koyomi's way.\n\nThirty minutes later after Koyomi sends a message to a particular person, an explosion rocks the abandoned cram school building, and Black Hanekawa appears.\nAnd initially, she spoke in Tsubasa's alarmed tone, as if concerned about Koyomi.\nBlack Hanekawa soon takes over once again, and realizes that they were just tricked by Koyomi.\nAnd she, both Tsubasa and Black Hanekawa are not happy about it.\nThen, Koyomi reveals his suspicion throughout this time as Black Hanekawa appears to be lacking a particular verbal tic... that Black Hanekawa is none other than Tsubasa Hanekawa herself, and the line between Tsubasa and the sawarinekois more blurred than what it seems. Nonetheless, Koyomi knows that Tsubasa is Tsubasa, and he just exploited Tsubasa's impulse to helping others to lure her out quickly.    \nSoon Koyomi points out Tsubasa's kindness, her strength, and her virtue, all of which can hurt a person's heart or pressure them down and tells her that she can't do anything about it. And he tells Tsubasa to live with what she is right now.    \nTsubasa finally speaks, and she points out that she cannot do everything and that she is human.\nKoyomi disagrees. He knows that Tsubasa, as of this moment, is an oddity.\nTsubasa finds Koyomi's words as harsh, but Koyomi insists that she has no right to call herself a human and he will never give her even a piece of sympathy. Koyomi admits that he does not know about Tsubasa's real parents, but he does know about her unfortunate life with a family that is not bound to her by blood. And he does not care about it, especially he knows that Tsubasa will eventually return to her routine life when they are finished talking.\nHe continues to remind Tsubasa that unhappiness will never go away despite how much happiness one has, and that is one of the painful truths of reality.\nHe will never sympathize with her. Yet, he is willing to be the person that will relieve her stress with everything he has.\n\nTsubasa is rather annoyed at Koyomi's talk. She thinks that Koyomi wants to be a star, but refuses to be a hero, to which Koyomi responds that the only thing he can become right now is a vampire. She then responds by saying that she has been suspicious that Koyomi feels hate towards her. Koyomi admits that he actually hates Tsubasa, and she returns the sentiment.\nTsubasa's composure quickly fizzles out by the second, as she mutters the word, \"die\".\nThen, she says, \"I should just die.\"\nAfterwards, Black Hanekawa takes over, and she declares that Koyomi must relieve Tsubasa's stress right now. Koyomi, in response, spreads his arms apart and lets Tsubasa do her way with him.\nA split second after, Black Hanekawa charges towards him, and Koyomi flies back into the wall behind him.\nIt was a few seconds later that he discovers that his lower half is still standing a few feet away.\nBlood spills from where Koyomi's upper and lower half separated.\nAnd Koyomi is overwhelmed by the unstoppable sensation of pain.\n\nBut not only Koyomi is in pain right now. Black Hanekawa is also on the floor, clutching her pained hand despite the absence of a visible wound. Then, a blade appears to jut out of Koyomi's lower half... the oddity-killer, the Kokorowatari. Koyomi, despite his grave injury, explains that the sword's existence was unknown to everyone, even to Meme, and he takes this to his advantage to attack the sawarineko using an unusual method, although he admits that he is not certain that he will succeed in this plan of his.\nThen, Koyomi urges Tsubasa to stop talking about death and to accept that she doesn't know anything, like she always says.\nAfterwards, after blood bursts out of his mouth, he stopped moving.\nIn this unmoving state, Koyomi is somewhat relieved that he has finally died for Tsubasa's sake. But he decided not to completely destroy the sawarineko unlike what Meme planned to, since it would not solve Tsubasa's problem with her stress management and her family. With that aside, he tells himself once again that although a pointless and a worthless wish, Koyomi was relieved that he was able to die for her sake.\n\nThen, a painful scream, even louder than before, awakens Koyomi once again. There, he sees Tsubasa writhing around in pain as white fur emerges from her skin and more feline features emerge from her body. Koyomi thinks that what he just did had an adverse reaction, causing Tsubasa to develop cat-like features. He tries to talk his way into stopping the sawarineko from going out of control, but it was no use.\nSuddenly, a girl with golden hair appears, telling Koyomi that it is normal for a machine to get damaged if someone pulls its plug right out of its socket. Then, after voicing her disappointment for Koyomi's unusual way in using her sword, the girl, who will be named Shinobu Oshino in the future, rips away her left arm and spills her blood on Koyomi's dismembered body. In an instant, Koyomi's unmoving legs in the distance disappears into dust and rejoins itself into Koyomi's body. Afterwards, Shinobu puts back her left arm and leaps away from Koyomi.\nShinobu is rather angry at Koyomi's decision to die for someone else's sake while letting her live back then, but decides to fight in his behalf using the Kokorowatari.\nAfter swallowing the blade whole, Shinobu quickly leaps into Tsubasa's back, and bites into Tsubasa's neck. A few seconds passed, and the rampaging oddity is swiftly suppressed.\n\nMinutes later, only Koyomi and Tsubasa are left in the room, and as Tsubasa lies unconscious, Koyomi can't help but pity themselves for their current situation, since they will be suffering this misfortune for the rest of their lives. However, Tsubasa, who is too weak to stand or move, refuses to give up.\n\nThe day after, on May 8th, after a quick breakfast, Koyomi heads off to visit someone before going to school. After finally burying the sawarineko where it is supposed to be buried, he goes to Meme's place, where Shinobu now wears a helmet. Meme explains that Shinobu compelled him to buy it for her, and decides to give it as a reward for what she did in the sawarineko case. Koyomi, on the other hand, realizes that he will not be able to pat her on the head because of it.\nKoyomi then asks about Tsubasa's current condition. Meme tells him that she is fine, and that she has forgotten everything about what happened during Golden Week, especially what happened to Black Hanekawa, the name he has recently given to the sawarineko who possess Tsubasa. Meme then hypothesizes that the sawarineko had the chance to leave by the time Tsubasa's parents were attacked, but Tsubasa brought the oddity closer to her, creating Black Hanekawa in the process.\nKoyomi then wonders if Tsubasa was actually possessed by a demon that normal people would call a family, but Meme points out that Tsubasa doesn't consider her family as family, and Koyomi agrees, even adding that Tsubasa may find the concept of \"family\" as an oddity in itself.\n\nSoon, Koyomi wonders about the reason why Tsubasa decided to stay despite being possessed by the sawarineko. Before Koyomi could finish his sentence, Meme tells Koyomi to marry Tsubasa, much to Koyomi's shock. Meme thinks that this will solve Tsubasa's problem with her family, but Koyomi thinks that it is a bad joke. Meme, however, thinks that it is a good idea, especially since the two have helped each other during spring break.\nMeme thinks that Tsubasa has feelings for him. However, Koyomi tells him that he is not in love with Tsubasa, unlike what Meme thought. Regardless, Meme still welcomes the possibility, since he thinks that Tsubasa's feelings are more important than Koyomi's.\nMeme soon talks about the resolved case with the sawarineko. He thinks that no matter what Koyomi or Tsubasa did, rescue will always be at arm's reach. Koyomi remembered that Tsubasa did not ask help from him. But, he knows that he will help her even if she did not ask for help [proof needed]. Meme then tells him that her not asking for help does not already mean that she doesn't need anyone's help. Likewise, her not saying that she loves him doesn't mean that she doesn't love him.\n\nAfter leaving the abandoned cram school building, a more relaxed Koyomi bikes his way across town.\nAs he arrives at Naoetsu Private High School, he has finally decided.\nNow that he has learned to feel for others, Koyomi vows to fall in love with someone other than Tsubasa. However, he will cling to the memory of those nine days and cherish them. And his feelings he had for her will never be forgotten no matter what happens in the future.\nAnd so, during the Golden Week of my third year in high school, the May of my 18th year,Araragi Koyomi fell out of love for the first time though he wasn't in love. \nAnd as he climbs the stairs to his class, a new story begins."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Nisemonogatari","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nisemonogatari","toc":["#Etymology","#Synopsis",{"#English_Release_Synopsis":["#Part_1","#Part_2"]},"#Introduced_Characters",{"#Plot":["#Karen_Bee","#Tsukihi_Phoenix"]},"#Illustrations","#English_Edition_Color_Pages","#Trivia","#Anime"],"Description":"Nisemonogatari (偽物語) or NISEMONOGATARI: Fake Tale in the English publication, comprised of two volumes, is the third part of the Monogatari series.

In an instant, Araragi concludes that she is responsible for his current predicament, and Hitagi quickly admits that it is her doing, even throwing away the keys that would unlock the cuffs on Araragi's hands.\nSoon, Hitagi points out why she is doing this extreme thing to Koyomi: \"I'll protect you.\" Koyomi understands what Hitagi is trying to say, but he somewhat wished that she would be more direct when telling it to him.\nKoyomi soon asks Hitagi to hand him some food to eat. After Hitagi shows the contents of the plastic bag, he opts to have a drink instead, however, Hitagi has other plans. She drank half of the water from the bottle and, after playing with Koyomi for a bit, lets some water drip into her hand before asking Koyomi to lick the water from her fingertips. After that, Koyomi decides to ask Hitagi for a rice ball, and one gets shoved into his mouth. Hitagi then points out that she only had bought food from a convenience store, and she promises to prepare home-made lunch for him next time.\nAlthough initially, Senjougahara's motives are unclear, what she said earlier clearly reveals everything: \"I'll protect you.\" However, her methods are clearly extreme, for someone's lover.\n\nFlashback to the morning before: July 29, a Saturday.\nAraragi's daily tutor sessions with Tsubasa Hanekawa (and Hitagi on Sundays) is put on hold when Tsubasa fails to show up for personal reasons. On his way to the living room, he sees his younger sister Tsukihi, and he discovers that his other younger sister Karen is missing. Araragi thinks that his sisters are up to no good, and Tsukihi tells him to refrain from being too nosy when it comes to their personal affairs.\nSoon, Koyomi's inquisitiveness reaches a point where Tsukihi becomes annoyed by it. As Koyomi fends off a flying remote control thrown by his sister towards him, he thinks whether her sisters growing up would even solve his current problems... although he doesn't want someone too quiet like Nadeko Sengoku as a sister.\nKoyomi remembers being invited by Nadeko to come over to her house some time, so he decides to call his childhood friend. Nadeko momentarily startles Araragi by shouting over the phone, but she manages to calm down a bit, only to get excited when Koyomi decides to visit her house on the same day.\nAfter the call, he tells Tsukihi that she would come along as well. She is a bit surprised, and she tells Koyomi that Nadeko would prefer that he comes to her place alone. It appears that Tsukihi does not want to be in the way of Nadeko's bonding time with Koyomi, but Araragi thinks that he will only come there as a friend visiting another. Koyomi ends up going alone, but not until Tsukihi notices that her older brother has stopped going on sparring sessions with Karen.\nOf course, Koyomi is just trying to avoid hurting someone by using his vampire-granted physical strength.\nDuring his long walk to Nadeko's place, he sees the ghost named Mayoi Hachikuji walking at a distance. For a moment, Koyomi is split between visiting Nadeko and playing with Mayoi. However, he decides to go with Mayoi first.\nIn an instant, Koyomi showers Mayoi with kisses while tossing her in the air. Since Mayoi does not know who is doing such things to her, she snaps and goes on the offensive; fortunately, she manages to recognize Araragi, although she made a mistake on his first name.\nAfter clarifying how his first name is spelled, Koyomi, now joined by Mayoi, and they have an energetic conversation about what he is currently doing. Soon, the conversation shifts into a weird talk about money, convenience stores selling love, and plans for the series' closing theme song credits. Soon, Araragi talks about his secret about being a vampire. Mayoi thinks that it is find hiding a secret or two from his family, since sharing one's secrets means that one is ready to involve others into said secret.\nJust as things become serious for the two, Mayoi finds herself challenged by Araragi when it comes to her mastery of the Japanese language (i.e. shoving \"courage\" to words and changing its meaning entirely)... and Araragi would do a handstand when he is amazed by Mayoi's statements.\nMayoi manages to take Araragi down in three tries, and he does the handstand like he promised. However, she discovers that Araragi just wanted to take a peek at her panties. Koyomi ends up being kicked on the face by a flustered Mayoi, but he fights back by using Mayoi's witty comments back against her. As Mayoi admits her defeat, Araragi apologizes for calling her panties as \"childish\" as he tells that she actually wears semi-transparent black panties. Mayoi protests that she does not wear such a thing, but Araragi forces her to show her panties clearly to him.\nForced into a corner, Mayoi raises her skirt so that Koyomi could see her panties clearly... then a pie pan comes flying into his face.\nKoyomi and Mayoi soon continue on their conversation on keeping the supernatural a secret from everyone. Mayoi points out that keeping the supernatural unknown to people would make things much simpler, as people normally need to see what's on the stage and not what's behind it when watching a play. As for the case of his sisters, Mayoi advises him that he needs to find a way to lead them out of the supernatural world if needed; otherwise, it is better to do nothing.\nSoon, Araragi decides to say goodbye for now. Mayoi says that she is always wandering around, thinking whether she is close to his house... or when she will meet him soon again.\nAs Mayoi takes her leave, Araragi asks Mayoi: \"You aren't going to disappear, are you?\"\nHe remembers Meme Oshino's abrupt farewell, and he wonders if she would go away as abruptly as she is.\nMayoi chuckles and points out that he has been the kind of person who worries too much about others, while she and Shinobu were the people who always end up listening to his problems. She then asks Araragi if he would help her when she gets into bad trouble again. Araragi says that he would certainly help her, and he would hear out Mayoi if she has problems of her own.\nShe thinks that there is a reason why she remains on the living world, and she declares it as her mission to find out what this reason is. When the time that she leaves, she promises to say goodbye to him.\nAlthough Koyomi is a bit afraid about that certain moment, Mayoi assures him with a beaming smile."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Nisemonogatari Episode 02: Karen Bee, Part 2","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nisemonogatari_Episode_02:_Karen_Bee,_Part_2","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters",{"#Locations":["#New_Locations"]},"#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Referbacks","#Cultural_References","#Unanswered_Questions"]}],"Description":"\"Karen Bee, Part 2\" (かれんビー 其ノ壱, Karen Bī Sono Ni) is second episode of the Nisemonogatari anime series.

Soon, she invites Koyomi to play King's Game, but he thinks that there are too few players to properly play King's Game. However, Nadeko insists, assuring Koyomi that she can give out orders or follow them.\nKoyomi then decides to play The Game of Life instead, a game that they have played for a long time since they were small. As Nadeko starts the game, Koyomi tells to himself that he would never develop dirty thoughts at Nadeko, and she should be thankful for having a gentleman like him.\n\nSeveral minutes into the game, Koyomi asks Nadeko about what is going on recently, including any possible supernatural phenomena happening. Nadeko hasn't experienced anything regarding snake curses after being cured of one, although she has been hearing about a weird charm circulating throughout middle schools across the area. Another news is that Koyomi's sisters appear to be up to something, although considering that Nadeko knows that the Araragi sisters do not know anything about the supernatural, she assumes that they are only concerned about the nonsense circulating among students.\nWhat worries Nadeko is that the Fire Sisters probably know this... and instead of backing away pushes through, even though it is no longer their business. Koyomi thinks that he should talk to Karen as soon as possible.\nAfter Nadeko snaps Koyomi back to reality, the latter decides to play another game since their Game of Life is already about to finish. Nadeko suggests Twister this time.\nMinutes after that, Nadeko's mother arrives from work. Fortunately, he was able to get out of the house. For some reason however, Koyomi thinks that Nadeko's mother managed to \"save something important to Koyomi\" at that time.\n\nBy the riverside, Koyomi soon receives a call from Suruga Kanbaru, who at her lavish home wears only her underwear, a straw hat and a long scarf. Much to Koyomi's shock, Suruga announces that she will strip while she is in the middle of the conversation. Koyomi protests to her indecent display, but Suruga reminds him that she is inside her own bedroom, so things like what she should be wearing is not important.\nHowever, that statement eventually retaliated when Suruga's grandmother passed by the bedroom, whose door is wide open. At that moment, Suruga's energetic mood turns bleak; disregarding her mood, Koyomi tells Suruga that he will come over as promised to help her organize her things.\nAfter that, in a flash, Koyomi storms back into the Araragi Residence and takes off on his bike to the Kanbaru Residence.\n\nKoyomi, on his way to Suruga's house, sees a girl walking on her hands while doing a handstand. Koyomi decides to startle the girl by leaping with his bike in the air and tripping one of her hands, but the girl — who turns out to be Karen Araragi — performs a somersault before landing perfectly on the road.\nWithout any time to waste, Koyomi asks Karen about what she is doing. Karen tells him that she is doing \"community service\". Before Koyomi could ask for any specifics, Karen tells her brother to talk to her at evening instead and takes off, but not until making a call with an unknown person. Karen's final words before leaving is: \"It looks like this really will be over soon.\"\n\nKoyomi eventually reaches the Kanbaru Residence, and he is startled upon discovering a stark naked Suruga lying down on her bed as mountains of red books surround her. Although Koyomi is clearly stimulated by Suruga's current state, he apologizes for being inconsiderate. To repay for his ungentleman-like attitude, he decides to go by Suruga's requests throughout the day.\nSuruga gets dressed, and the piles of books that clutter her room are moved to another place, which appears to resemble a construction site. The move also helps out Kanbaru discover some of her personal things, including a jersey from Naoetsu Private High School's basketball team when the team reached the national competitions. Soon, their conversation shifts from her hair to her self-proclaimed eroticism.\nAraragi soon finds a novel — more importantly, a yaoi novel — and after Suruga refuses to throw the novel away, Koyomi thinks that Suruga might be actually be a pervert as he initially thought, especially since he thinks that girls wanting to see handsome boys together is perfectly normal. Soon, Koyomi's tone becomes too much for Suruga that she wanted to do anything for him to stop. However, Koyomi did not stop talking, and Suruga reaches the breaking point. She rushes through the room and tackles Koyomi into her bedsheet.\nIn an instant, Koyomi's and Suruga's roles become reversed. Suruga prepares to strip down Koyomi while the helpless half-vampire is held into a submission lock.\n\nAfter that ordeal, Koyomi promises to himself that he would never ever treat Mayoi the same way he treated her in the past."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#New_Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Nisemonogatari Episode 03: Karen Bee, Part 3","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nisemonogatari_Episode_03:_Karen_Bee,_Part_3","toc":["#Synopsis",{"#Characters":["#New_Characters"]},"#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Suruga","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Senjougahara","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Hanekawa","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanafuda","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Deishuu_Kaiki","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Meme_Oshino","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Guillotine_Cutter"],"text":"Suruga's room is finally cleaned up. Suruga thinks that Koyomi's cleaning skills would make him a good wife, but Koyomi doesn't like the idea of being a wife, being Kanbaru's wife and having her killed by Senjougahara because of said marriage in particular. Suruga then voices her opinion about a higher probability of Koyomi marrying Hanekawa instead of Senjougahara, an idea that drenches Koyomi in cold sweat.\nHowever, in the middle of their banter, Suruga has a much more serious message to him: to be careful of being kind to so many women. According to her, she prefers her current relationship with Koyomi, so she wouldn't do something that would ruin it. Meanwhile, Koyomi tells that Hanekawa is a girl whom he is highly indebted with, and he would not allow anything to happen to her (let alone suffer Hitagi's wrath). Suruga assures him that the two girls live in a different world, and she chooses to not intervene with what is currently between the two.\nKoyomi soon decides to change the mood by playing a deck of hanafuda cards he found among Suruga's belongings. It turns out that Suruga does not know how to play hanafuda, so Koyomi decides to end the game before Suruga's losing streak continues.\n\nAs afternoon approaches, Koyomi and Suruga had a more serious talk about their respective oddities. Koyomi wonders if Kanbaru has a hard time keeping her monkey's paw a secret to her grandparents; although Suruga was able to convince her relatives that it is an injury, she feels that they are not suspicious only because what happened to her mother caused them to be indifferent of her. Right now, all Suruga needed is to wait until her arm heals completely in time.\nKoyomi finally bids farewell to the Kanbaru Residence for the day. As the sky is tinged a deep crimson, a man stands in the distance. A man named Kaiki. Although this suspicious says that he has no interest in visiting the Kanbaru household, the fact that a certain Gaen lives nearby took his attention. However, upon sensing that the person he is interested in is no longer around, he leaves calmly, leaving behind a perplexed half-vampire who suddenly reminded himself of Meme Oshino, the man who suddenly disappeared before, and a certain Guillotine Cutter.\nAlthough he wanted to follow the man named Kaiki, intuition forced him to go the other way. He feels that the man is a threat, and it will be safe to keep himself from being involved with him.\n\nOn his way back, he sees Senjougahara. However, she ignores him and walks towards a nearby alleyway. Koyomi uses his superhuman strength to get to her in an instant, and he ends up confronted by Hitagi for skipping a tutorial session with Hanekawa. What's even more tense for Koyomi is that Hitagi, for some unknown reason, knows that he has been \"playing with\" girls while she is away. Koyomi soon pleads that she should calm herself down and avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Hitagi tells that her plan to take out all the other girls is just a joke, but it is also a warning for the consequences of not taking it seriously while they are dating.\nAfter receiving a dangerous lecture from Hitagi, Koyomi decides to accompany Hitagi, who is actually on her way home after a short shopping trip. During their conversation, Koyomi tells about seeing an unusual, more specifically, ill-omened, man in front of the Kanbaru residence. Unknown to him, the word \"Kaiki\" is the last word he would speak before he would find himself in chains in Meme's old residence.\n\nBack into the early morning of July 30th, Hitagi finally exposes that she knew a man named Kaiki... more specifically, Deishuu Kaiki, a man whose aura screams \"ill-omened\".\nShe tells Koyomi that Kaiki is the first of five conmen that swindled money from her while she is suffering from the effects of the \"heavy stone crab\", and that explains why his aura fells similar to Oshino or the Guillotine Cutter he mentioned earlier. Hitagi then shows her determination to protect Koyomi from the same man who brought her family to suffering, and even warns Koyomi that Kaiki might be too much for him. Her simple request: for Koyomi to stay where he is chained to until Kaiki leaves town; meanwhile, she prepares herself to kill Kaiki herself if he comes to wherever Koyomi is.\nKoyomi's phone soon lights up on the pocket of his pants. Hitagi gets the phone from his pocket, and after some struggling on Koyomi's part, Hitagi shows an orange screen that says: \"From: Younger Sister/Sub: Help Me\".\nIn an instant, Koyomi's eyes glow red and all of the chains and restraints Hitagi prepared for him were ripped apart. A calm Koyomi tells Hitagi that he needs to go to his sisters, and he manages to break down Hitagi's defense by a show of his cool talk. Meanwhile, Hitagi gets a call from Koyomi's phone, and for the first time, she acts less confident than before, as if there is a sudden change of plans.\n\nHitagi finally hands Koyomi's phone to him and apologizes for whatever she did.\nThen, when Koyomi asks who was on the other line a while ago, she tells that it is Hanekawa."},"#New_Characters":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Nisemonogatari Episode 04: Karen Bee, Part 4","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nisemonogatari_Episode_04:_Karen_Bee,_Part_4","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music","#Trivia"],"Description":"Nisemonogatari anime series is the fourth part of the Karen Bee story, which features Karen Araragi, one of Koyomi's two younger sisters, and a victim of an oddity that comes in the form of a bee.

To his surprise, Karen and Tsukihi are alright, so this caused him to confront the two regarding what is going on.\nKaren remains stubborn, refusing to divulge any answers for Koyomi's questions, and Koyomi reaches a point when he wanted to hit his younger sister. However, Tsubasa Hanekawa — now having a bowl cut hairstyle — intervenes, reminding him of how he reacted to Tsubasa's abuse by her father. As the elder Araragi gets scolded by Tsubasa, the Fire Sisters defend their older brother despite the fact that Koyomi is still mad at his sisters' false alarm. Tsubasa then tells Koyomi that she chose to work with the Fire Sisters on her own accord, so there is nothing to worry about.\nWith everything settled down, Koyomi shifts back to wanting to know what is going on with the Fire Sisters.\nKaren still refuses to speak up, even with Koyomi's promise to keep their conversation a secret to their parents.\nAs Koyomi loses his patience, he asks Tsubasa to go to his bedroom while he personally talks to his sisters. The conversation between the siblings is short, however; he only tells his younger sisters that they need to be strong to be a hero, and justice is not enough to be one. After leaving that message, he joins Tsubasa in his bedroom.\n\nIt turns out that Tsubasa has heard their conversation from inside Koyomi's bedroom, and this becomes their topic. Tsubasa notices that Koyomi has a unique way of treating his younger sisters, and it is different from how he treats the other girls in his life. Koyomi thinks that he knows better than Tsubasa when it comes to his sisters, whom he had known for the entirety of their lives. Tsubasa thinks that Koyomi — despite his denial — still treats his younger sisters as little kids, and she understands it somewhat.\nKoyomi soon shifts the topic to the current issue with the Fire Sisters... and a certain charm that has been circulating throughout middle schools in the area. Tsubasa is quite surprised that Koyomi knows about the rumors, but Koyomi points out that he only heard it from Nadeko. Meanwhile, they continue to discuss about the charm, and Koyomi discovers that Nadeko is not the only person who is affected by the charm; in fact, there are more cases, and Nadeko's ends up becoming the greatest of the cases.\nTsubasa soon reveals that she has been contacting the Fire Sisters for some time now (and Tsubasa is actually the one who contacted Karen the day before), and she is actually exerting her effort in trying to find out who is responsible for the spread of the charms.\nHowever, one day, the culprit that Karen wanted to confront ends up doing something to her, and Tsubasa finds herself responsible for not meeting Karen in time. Fortunately, Karen told Tsubasa who the culprit is, and it turns out that it is an ill-omened man named Deishuu Kaiki involved in what's going on.\nAt the end of their conversation, Koyomi asks how Tsubasa managed to get Hitagi into helping her. Tsubasa simply says that she threatened Hitagi that she will ask Koyomi to be her boyfriend if she doesn't become a good girl. At that moment, Koyomi thought that Tsubasa can be a scary lady at times.\n\nKoyomi soon decides to cool off by taking a bath. During this \"moment of solitude\", however, he is accompanied by Shinobu Oshino, a young girl who is the remnant of a powerful vampire, now living in his shadow. Koyomi is shocked to see Shinobu — a girl who lethargically stays in one place in Meme's place — now energetic and even talking at him with a confident tone.\nHe asks if she is the one who broke through the handcuffs that restrained him, and Shinobu confirms it, even taking out the handcuffs that stayed in Koyomi's wrists and eating them. Shinobu, however, considers her \"helping hand\" as merely pure coincidence.\nSoon, Shinobu requests Koyomi to wash her hair using a substance called \"shampoo\". Koyomi decides to let her get what she wants, and even uses conditioner to her hair.\nAs Koyomi washes Shinobu's hair, the young girl reminds Koyomi that they have a \"mutual feeling of aversion\" towards each other. However, she thinks that they are inseparable despite that fact. She also accepts that she cannot stay down for long, and she asks Koyomi to indulge her if necessary.\n\nAfter the bath is finished, Shinobu shares her insight on what is going on. She explains the existence of a \"flame wreath bee\", a supernatural version of the Japanese giant hornet... and the oddity that has inflicted his tall younger sister. According to Shinobu, it is an oddity that stems from the fourteenth or fifteenth century, and it is famous for causing an intense fever followed by death to its victims.\nKoyomi did not notice a thing... and to make things worse, Hanekawa is covering up for her.\nKoyomi, nonetheless, thinks that Karen is partly responsible for what happened to her, something that disappoints Shinobu, although she knows that Koyomi has always been harsh towards his sisters. Meanwhile, Koyomi thinks that Kaiki used something supernatural to poison his sister, but Shinobu is a bit suspicious, since if Senjougahara says that Kaiki an impostor and a con man, Kaiki would not be able to do such a feat.\nBut, that does not mean that it is an impossibility. In fact, Shinobu thinks that it is possible that the person itself might be an oddity in itself. The only way is to confirm Kaiki's identity to Senjougahara.\n\nThat leaves Karen's fever as the only concern.\nKoyomi suggests to Shinobu that she eat the disease. Shinobu tells him that she can easily make a snack out of the flame wreath bee, but she cannot consume the effects of the bee sting. She thinks that it is possible that Meme knows about how to counter the bee sting, but she is too uninterested on his long and winding lectures.\nMeanwhile, Shinobu notices that Koyomi's eyes are getting too fixed at her juvenile body. Although Koyomi wants to deny it, Shinobu continuously teases him for it, and she even uses it to extort a huge pile of donuts to keep herself quiet. However, Koyomi smartly uses Shinobu's dependence on his shadow against Shinobu, which amazed her.\n\nThen, Tsukihi comes barging in, and when she sees Koyomi sharing the bath tub with a young girl, she hurries to the kitchen to get a knife. Fortunately, Shinobu hides before any bloodshed could start. Koyomi soon ends up deluding Tsukihi into thinking that she is imagining things, but that did not stop the younger of the Fire Sisters to be frightening with a kitchen knife in one hand.\nAs soon as Tsukihi leaves, Shinobu jumps back into the tub, seemingly amused that Koyomi has a scary little sister. Then, their topic returns to Shinobu and Koyomi themselves. Shinobu hypothesizes that it is possible that Koyomi might live for as long as half a millennium due to his half-vampire blood, and she considers that if such a scenario happens, everyone he loves and holds dear will be killed by Time, and they will be the only ones left.\nThere, Shinobu comes up with a suggestion: Koyomi should kill her if he wanted to become a human again.\nHowever, Koyomi strongly refuses. He says that he does not forgive Shinobu as she does not forgive him... and that is all there is. Shinobu, as she leans on Koyomi's chest, tells him that she will be biding time until the moment when Koyomi exposes a weakness... and when that time comes, she will kill him instantly.\nKoyomi, in response, strokes Shinobu's hair and calmly smiles.\n\nAt that moment, Shinobu and Koyomi come to a reconciliation, albeit a small step towards it."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Trivia":{"link":[],"text":"This episode marks the first time when Shinobu Oshino speaks in an anime episode of the Monogatari series.\nLikewise, this episode marks the first episode where Tsubasa Hanekawa sports her new hairstyle.\nThis episode is the first time that the bathroom in the Araragi residence is shown, the bathroom has a clawfoot slipper bathtub."}},{"id":"Nisemonogatari Episode 05: Karen Bee, Part 5","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nisemonogatari_Episode_05:_Karen_Bee,_Part_5","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Music","#Trivia"],"Description":"","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsukihi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Karen","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsubasa","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kaiki","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Meme_Oshino","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Shinobu"],"text":"Right after having a bath, Koyomi, dressed with only a bath towel, confronts his younger sister Tsukihi about Karen. After the younger of the Fire Sisters asks Koyomi not to be mad at Karen, their conversation suddenly veers off-course when Tsukihi displays her hysterical side. It turns out that Tsukihi is hesitant to tell about what happened to her Karen, and she would end up delaying the topic until the commotion she makes causes Tsubasa Hanekawa, who is tending the feverish Karen, to go down stairs and scold the two.\nOf course, Koyomi promises to turn down the volume, but a sudden slip of Koyomi's towel causes Tsubasa to scream in response.\n\nTsukihi and Tsubasa soon fill Koyomi up with details of what happened to Karen.\nAccording to their testimony, Karen meets up with Kaiki with the intent of punishing him. Although Karen displayed a degree of determination that even amazed Kaiki, she soon found that determination being broken down by Kaiki's talk. Kaiki calmly states that his intention of selling charms to middle school students is all for the money — he expects that he would earn 3,000,000 yen on his activity — and he calls himself a con man, much to Karen's disgust.\nKaren prepares to attack Kaiki as he approaches her, but all it took for Kaiki to defeat her was one touch on the forehead. In an instant, Karen was inflicted by an immobilizing fever, and Kaiki takes his time to take what little money is in Karen's wallet before quietly leaving.\n\nThat night, Tsubasa is accompanied by Koyomi on her way home. Surprisingly, Koyomi is calm despite what happened to his younger sister, and Tsubasa wanted to apologize for being too intrusive to his sisters. Koyomi is not angry at her, however; he just prefers that she had told her intentions earlier. Tsubasa then comments on how similar the Fire Sisters were to Koyomi, and he just responds by telling her that it is normal for members of a family to act similar.\nTsubasa then mentions about Meme Oshino, the person who saved them both from their respective oddities once. Koyomi still believes that he is somewhere watching over them, and he might end up helping them tackle Karen's sickness. Their topic soon shifts to Shinobu, whom Tsubasa thinks is the reason why Meme decided to leave — and leave behind Shinobu to Koyomi's care. As they continue on their way to Tsubasa's house, they talk about Koyomi's relationship with Shinobu; in this conversation, Tsubasa warns that problems might happen even right after a reconciliation.\nFurther down the road, Tsubasa decides that she would go back home alone, and Koyomi decides to lend his bike to Tsubasa. As she prepares to leave, she tells Koyomi to solve Karen's problem as soon as possible as she needs to tutor Koyomi the day after.\n\nBack at home, Koyomi carries Karen to his bedroom and tends to her needs. While she doesn't have an appetite to eat even canned fruits, Koyomi decides to clean his sister's body instead. Of course, she is embarrassed to have her body wiped by a boy, even if it is her brother, but Koyomi stubbornly continues to take care of Karen.\nSoon, Karen tells her opinion about what happened to her on the encounter with Kaiki. She is still mad about Kaiki's intent to fool those much younger than him and making money out of deception, and she still defends her actions, even though it is inappropriate given the situation. Finally, Karen declares that she will still do what she did, no matter what the outcome would be.\n\nThroughout their conversation, Koyomi continues to wipe down the sweat from Karen's body. She soon tells Koyomi that he should stop wiping her body for too long, in fear that she might transmit her sickness to him. At that moment, Koyomi had an idea.\nOutside his room, Koyomi contacts Shinobu and asks if there is a possibility that he can transfer Karen's fever to himself instead. Shinobu thinks that such a scenario is possible, but she would not recommend it; she clarifies that it's not because of a certain \"risk\", but something else, entirely. Koyomi thinks that they should take any chance to get Karen well again, and Shinobu decides to help out.\n\nKoyomi soon returns to Karen, and as he quickly grabs the older Fire Sister by the shoulders, Koyomi declares that he will kiss his sister."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Trivia":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nisemonogatari_Episode_05:_Karen_Bee,_Part_5","https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbakemonogatari.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FNisemonogatari_Episode_05%3A_Karen_Bee%2C_Part_5%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D5&uselang=en"],"text":"Navigation[]"}},{"id":"Nisemonogatari Episode 06: Karen Bee, Part 6","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nisemonogatari_Episode_06:_Karen_Bee,_Part_6","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"","#Synopsis":{"link":[],"text":"Despite Koyomi's best efforts, he has failed to extract all of the poison of the wreathe-fire bee from his younger sister Karen. Fortunately, his attempt to cure helped bring down her fever. The day that followed, he goes out of his house, and during his walk across town, he sees a familiar backpack.\nThe thought of swooping down and molesting his favorite victim came to his mind, but for some reason, Koyomi decided to greet his friend, Mayoi Hachikuji, with a pat on her shoulder and a simple hello. Mayoi bitterly responds by saying that his actions has revealed to her that he has become boring, and simply walks away. Koyomi tries to justify his actions, thinking that her protests every time he touches her \"where one should not touch her\" is sincere, but Mayoi reveals that she actually meant the opposite when she wanted Koyomi to stop. However, since Koyomi decided to stop doing what he had always done to Mayoi, she decided to treat Koyomi like someone unfamiliar, since nothing much is left of Koyomi if he takes away his tendency to be too clingy to her.\nMayoi continues to tell Koyomi to go away, but Koyomi refuses.\n\nSoon, Mayoi decides to finally open a conversation with Koyomi by commenting on how Koyomi looked serious compared to the day before. Koyomi tells Mayoi that many things have happened, and Mayoi chose to not ask anything about it. Mayoi then senses something off about Koyomi, much to his shock, and he ends up telling about the wreathe-fire bee, the oddity that attacked his younger sister Karen.\nKoyomi proceeds to rant about his younger siblings acting like idiots sometimes, putting themselves in harm's way to do what they think is right. Mayoi, in response, jokes that Koyomi might actually be just as idiotic as his sisters sometimes as well, but reminds Koyomi that they might have helped a lot of people in those \"idiotic things\" they do. Koyomi still considers his sisters as children, and he finds himself responsible for their actions until they are ready.\nMayoi is then asked by Koyomi about what she thinks is the age needed for a person to become an adult. According to her, a person becomes an adult by the age of 20, but is also subject to change depending on the era. Regardless, she thinks that one can become an adult just by undergoing the process of time. Koyomi realizes that asking for his middle-school sisters to grow up is a tall order, and Mayoi responds by telling him that his sister's childish behavior is natural for kids like them... and the problem comes when those children do not acknowledge that fact that they are still young.\nKoyomi soon shifts the topic to Mayoi, and she responds by comparing herself to a particular manga character (see Cultural References section), much to Koyomi's shock.\n\nLater, Koyomi approaches Hitagi's place and decides to part ways with Mayoi. Although their farewell is lighthearted, Koyomi's mind is filled with worry for his friend, who disappears into the summer sun.\n\nAt Room 201 of Tamikurasou, Koyomi nervously enters Hitagi's house, which is filled with the sound of wood being chipped away and wood shavings from dozens of pencils. Hitagi asks if a situation wherein 100 pencils are found embedded on a particular someone's body is considered as a homicide. A terrified Koyomi points out that it counts as first-degree murder, and in response, Hitagi decides to sharpen more pencils to make a point. Meanwhile, with a cutter in hand, she then decides to invite Koyomi to come in, promising not to cuff him unlike the last time.\nHitagi soon reveals that she is sharpening a staggering amount of pencils to attack Deishuu Kaiki with, since she has planned a meeting with him and because Koyomi refused her \"protection\" (i.e., being chained and cuffed while being hand-fed for days).\nAfter protesting about Hitagi's twisted definition of the word \"protection\", Koyomi mentions having talked to Tsubasa that day as well. Hitagi slipped as she calls Tsubasa \"Hanekawa-sama\", and tries to cover it up by saying that she was not bullied, which contributed more to Koyomi's worry towards her.\nTheir conversation soon returns to Kaiki. Hitagi shows an old business card she had of Kaiki and decides to follow it to track him down, but Koyomi appears to doubt the credibility of the business card, since he knew that Kaiki is supposed to be a conman. Hitagi assures him that she was able to contact Kaiki by using the number in the business card.\n\nThen, Koyomi decides to tag along.\nHitagi points a sharpened pencil just inches from his eye and threatens him to not think about coming with her in the meeting with Kaiki, or else suffer a painful death. Despite this, Koyomi pleads to Hitagi, telling her that he has a reason for confronting Kaiki as well, and Hitagi understood, although she still prefers to go alone. Koyomi then points out that there is another reason why he chose to confront Kaiki, and it was Hitagi herself; he knew that Hitagi's decision is reckless, so he decides to protect her from getting herself hurt.\nMeanwhile, Hitagi tells Koyomi that Kaiki is a person that she would still seek for even if he never returned to town, and she is willing to leave her home just to track him down. Koyomi questions Hitagi's obsession over Kaiki, but Hitagi reminds Koyomi that Kaiki is responsible for the destruction of her family, although it is implied that she might actually blame more things than what actually happened to Kaiki alone.\nAnd Koyomi knew about this, especially because he knows that she has met the crab way before Kaiki.\nSoon, Koyomi wonders about how \"fake\" Kaiki was, especially since despite being a conman, he was supposed to have seen the crab. Hitagi doubts so, but she also considers the fact that being a fake might actually be a fake in itself... a falsification of incompetence, all for maximizing income. Koyomi then thinks about Kaiki's newest victims, including his younger sister Karen, who is described as Hitagi as a \"hero-man\" like him. Hitagi reminds Koyomi that a truly evil person is impervious to any \"right\", and a drastic measure must be taken to defeat someone like him. Koyomi, however, refuses to take Hitagi's plan to stick pencils into him as an option, as it would make justice turn against her, and will pull her away from him.\nKoyomi insisted to come with Hitagi after expressing his love and concern for Hitagi. Hitagi is taken by Koyomi's words and decides to abide by his decisions, but only after meeting particular \"conditions\", which she decided to reveal only when they have met Kaiki personally. Although Koyomi wanted to know what this \"condition\" is, Hitagi was able to persuade him into being patient about it.\nAs it was getting too late, Koyomi decides to go home for the meantime, waiting for the time when they will meet Kaiki. Although Koyomi knows that he can handle situations even with little sleep, Hitagi still asks Koyomi to rest, as she knows that Kaiki is too much to handle without a decent rest.\n\nUpon arriving at the Araragi residence, a teary-eyed Tsukihi tells Koyomi that Karen has gone missing. Before her hysteria could consume her, Koyomi calms her down and asks for more details. However, Tsukihi knows little about her possible whereabouts, although she suspects that Karen is heading towards Kaiki's place. Koyomi then decides to find Karen himself, and leaves behind Tsukihi.\nAs Koyomi, filled with anger and worry, tries to sort out Karen's possible moves, he is suddenly accompanied by a young girl with blond hair, dressed in a loose white dress — Shinobu Oshino. Shinobu remarks about the common recklessness between Karen and Koyomi, and Koyomi responds by asking if she will help or just tease him. Shinobu reminds Koyomi that their relationship is complicated, yet they are bound together as fellow vampires. She also adds that she cannot refuse anything that he orders to her. Koyomi refuses to give orders to Shinobu, and in response, she decides to not help him...\n...right after telling her that she is willing to help, as long as he gives out the request in the way she wants.\n\nAfter Koyomi gives out the \"order\" to search for Karen, Shinobu quickly goes to work, using Koyomi's blood as a basis for searching for Karen by smell.

Despite her condition, Karen refuses to back down and leave things to her brother, but neither does Koyomi, who continues to persuade Karen to take a rest instead of taking on Kaiki herself.\nKaren decides that fighting is the only way for Koyomi to change his mind about taking her home, but Koyomi shows that he is not interested in fighting her, especially in her dismal condition. Karen, however, prepares her fighting stance, and declares that her sickly condition is her best condition yet.\nKoyomi refuses to believe that his sister is capable of fighting against him (especially with vampire blood in his veins).\nThen, Karen disappears, only to reappear with an elbow ready to strike. A short exchange of blows right after that, the part-vampire is planted into the yellow circular bench behind him. Koyomi is clearly dumbfounded about his sister's strength.\nKaren prepares to leave with the next bus, thinking that Koyomi should be taken care of, but she was shocked at seeing Koyomi stand up after being hit by her attacks. Koyomi decides to use force to bring Karen back home, only to find himself at the mercy of Karen's powerful blows, and is thrown from one place to another by her strength.\nSoon, Shinobu contacts Koyomi, reminding the part-vampire that she could feel a part of his pain, and is waiting for Koyomi to give his orders to fight back. Despite his grave condition, Koyomi tells Shinobu to stand down for the meantime, in exchange for a pat to the head. Shinobu has other plans though, as she wants Koyomi to stroke her breasts instead.\nKoyomi is shocked by Shinobu's request, but is quickly roused back to reality by Karen's jabs to his face.\nKaren appears to be losing her patience as her hands begin to hurt from punching Koyomi and tells his brother to stop trying to win, but Koyomi's resolve did not waver. She then decides to stop using her hands in fighting... and instead punishes Koyomi using her feet.\nKoyomi finds himself in more pain as a flurry of attacks from his sister drives him into a foundation beam, knocking down an entire section of a nearby bridge.\nBut Koyomi was still able to stand on his feet.\n\nKaren soon confronts about Koyomi's relentless lectures towards her and Tsukihi about \"justice\", that they were \"right\" but not strong, and tells him that since justice always wins, as the Fire Sisters of justice, she always aims to win. Koyomi remembers saying that his sisters are not strong, but reminds Karen that her physical strength is not enough; moreover, steeling the mind is just as important as well.\nKoyomi then tells Karen that her sense of justice is flawed, such that her constant reliance to the pleas of others robs her of her right to do what she truly wills to do.\nThey are not heroes of justice. They are kids trying to pretend as if they are, Koyomi says.\nThey are impostors.\nKaren refuses to yield to her brother's talk and holds on to Tsubasa, someone who knows everything and she thinks can understand their situation, as defense. But Koyomi breaks down Karen's defense, telling her that Tsubasa \"doesn't know everything\" and \"just knows what she knows\". He then adds that he thinks that Karen is not yet ready for \"big\" words like \"self-sacrifice\" and \"justice\".\nAs rubble continues to stir around them, Karen continues to hold on to her beliefs, but as Koyomi approaches her and embraces her, she slowly yields to his brotherly words. Koyomi tells Karen that although she and her sister are troublemakers and always makes their brother worry, he is still proud of them, and he will do whatever it takes for them.\nKaren finally gives in to her brother's words and is carried back home by Koyomi. Afterwards, he and Hitagi prepare to head to Kaiki.\n\nIn an empty amusement park, Kaiki, standing on a theater stage, looks on as Koyomi and Hitagi, with their respective reasons to confront him, walk forward. Kaiki reveals that he knows about why they chose to meet him, while Hitagi tells him that she wished to have not met him in the first place if she was given an option to, but is now willing to meet with him.\nAfter Koyomi and Hitagi reveal their requests to Kaiki, the conman promptly responds, saying that he will stop swindling from middle school students. He also tells Koyomi that Karen's condition was simply a minor application of hypnosis and she will recover soon, while he apologizes to Hitagi for what happened to her mother and her family's money and promises to repay them as soon as possible.\nHowever, Hitagi refuses to believe his words. And her doubts intensify as Kaiki spoke words of apology with a straight face.\nHitagi appears to be slowly losing her composure, but she manages to keep herself from unleashing her murderous intent against Kaiki. She tells Kaiki that his actions will never bring her family back together, much to his pleasure, and asks him to leave the town immediately. Kaiki quickly accepts Hitagi's offer, but soon notices Koyomi's look on his face.\nKaiki remarks that Koyomi eyes lack the hostility he expects after what happened to Karen, but Koyomi tells him that he thinks that Karen deserved what happened to her, especially taking him on alone. Kaiki then tells Koyomi that Karen actually did the right thing, instead of bringing along someone else with her.\nThen, Kaiki comments that without kind girls like Karen, his business would be dull.\n\nHitagi is close to losing her patience as she realizes that Kaiki had just used a girl's kindness for his own gain, but Kaiki clarifies a possible misunderstanding, telling her that he is just a normal person who just wants to earn some cash, although Hitagi adds that he is an imposter on top of everything.\nSoon, Kaiki looks at Koyomi, whom he thinks is someone extraordinary, who has something unusual in his shadows and was responsible for weakening Karen's sickness. After commending on Koyomi's risk-taking move, Kaiki is asked by Koyomi whether he is a specialist in the supernatural or not. Kaiki, in response, tells him about ghosts, explaining how people can still be afraid of ghosts despite not believing in them. Then, he answers Koyomi's question: he knows not of the supernatural, but knows people who do... although some of them might have been fooled by Kaiki himself into believing that they do.\nSoon, Kaiki talks about the flame-wreathe bee and reveals that the origins of this oddity are fake. Moreover, Kaiki believes that there is no such thing as the supernatural, and by extension, there should be no victims of the supernatural to begin with.\nAlthough he still tells Koyomi that Karen's \"sickness\" will take some time to wear off, but it might be shorter than usual due to Koyomi's intervention.\nKaiki soon tells Koyomi that they are the kind of person who cannot mix well together, and compares himself with rubidium, and Koyomi with water, which when put in contact, will produce an explosive result. Meanwhile, Koyomi considers that he has a similar problem with his sisters and, following Kaiki's analogy, compares them with fire.\n\nHitagi asks Kaiki for his phone, and after receiving it from Kaiki, breaks it into two and buries it under the sole of her shoe. Kaiki laments at the fate of his phone, which holds the numbers of his \"clients\", but Hitagi tells him that she no longer cares about the fate of those who were fooled by Kaiki's schemes. Hitagi considers herself to be an enemy of evil, not a paragon of justice, and so presses the responsibility to the victims for having themselves fooled by a conman. Hitagi also says that she knows that Kaiki has no ability to rescue them even if he wanted, and his attempts would just be further deception on his part.\nSenjougahara is disgusted at Kaiki's show of his pride in being a conman and shoots down his remarks about her, telling him to stop insulting her for what she is right now, which Koyomi has fallen in love with.\nKaiki realizes that the two are actually a couple and gives up in their conversation. Upon walking away from the two, Kaiki says that he will leave town quietly, and will be completely gone by tomorrow.\nThen, Kaiki decides to tell a short story to Hitagi, regardless of her interest to listen.\nIt is about the man who almost sexually assaulted her way back in the past. Kaiki tells him that that man was run over by a car and died, somewhere and sometime that has nothing to do with her. Then, before leaving, Kaiki reminds the two that one should not expect life to be as exciting as the plot of a theatrical play. Hitagi, cautious of Kaiki's words, voices out her doubts about the truth in his words, but Kaiki complicates things even further by asking her if she thought that those things she thought were whole truths are actually true.\nHitagi is dumbfounded by this statement. Meanwhile, Kaiki reminds himself that what happened between him and Hitagi in the past was just a simple crush and nothing else, much to Koyomi's shock.\nKaiki then tells Hitagi to forget the past since there is no point in getting over it or catching up with it and to just be happy with what she has right now.\n\nWith that, Kaiki disappears.\n\nKoyomi decides to confirm Hitagi's relationship with Kaiki and, in response, she wonders if this is Koyomi's way of finding out if she is still pure, much to Koyomi's embarrassment. Hitagi then tells him that there's no way that she'll fall for him, although she admits that there was a time when she treats anyone who is willing to help her like a knight in shining armor, and Kaiki was the first who received this kind of treatment from her. Thus, if anyone else would have helped her, she might have ended up with that person instead.\nHitagi admits that she feels disgusted thinking about those possibilities, so she is relieved that she was saved by Koyomi.\nKoyomi reminds Hitagi that, like Meme told her, she was the one who saved herself.\nSoon, Hitagi prepares to head back home when Koyomi reminds her of the request she gave to Koyomi the day before. Initially, Koyomi thought that Hitagi wanted to praise her for being able to close an important chapter in her life, but Hitagi clarifies that even his compliments are not enough for her, and she expects him to be much more than that.\nKoyomi wonders if Hitagi is made up of iron to act so tough around him. However, Hitagi proves that she is just as soft and kind as any other girl by revealing to Koyomi that she is actually badly wounded by Kaiki's harsh words.\nSo, Hitagi's request for Koyomi was for him to \"be gentle with her\".\nThe next day,  Koyomi is surprised to find out that Karen is back in good shape, and soon roughly explains the current situation to her and Tsukihi, especially the part where Kaiki would leave town. However, the Fire Sisters of Tsuganoki 2nd Middle School would continue their duties as \"heroes of justice\", helping out those affected by the charms instead.\nKoyomi watches on as the two impostor-sisters he is proud of run into their next adventure."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Nisemonogatari Episode 08: Tsukihi Phoenix, Part 1","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nisemonogatari_Episode_08:_Tsukihi_Phoenix,_Part_1","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"","#Synopsis":{"link":[],"text":"Tsukihi Araragi. The younger of Koyomi's two younger sisters. Born in April, 14 years old, currently in second year of middle school. One of the Fire Sisters. Blood type B. A hysteric, sly, prone to heights of emotion...\nand an immortal.\nThis is the story of another fake.\n\nAugust 14th, Sunday morning.\nKoyomi's early morning study session is interrupted by Koyomi's elder younger sister Karen, who insists in helping him at anything while putting him on a triangle choke. Koyomi, expecting the hot-blooded girl who beat him up recently, releases himself from Karen's grasp, only to discover that Karen, who is usually seen wearing baggy shorts, is now wearing a skirt.\nA hysterical Koyomi urges Karen to tell him if there is someone who bullies her into wearing such feminine clothing, but Karen assures her that there is no one who is forcing her to switch into the style she is wearing now. To add, Karen points out that it was Koyomi himself who is the only one who bullied her, reminding him that his words that almost brought her to suicide when she was in elementary were also the words that caused her to shift to her current athletic character.\nRegardless, Koyomi insists Karen to divulge any contacts of those who bully her, and Karen simply comments that her brother is hotter than fire sometimes.\n\nKaren points out that she is not cosplaying, and neither is she being bullied and asks if her clothes are cute on her. Although Koyomi is reluctant to answer, Karen's menacing glare is enough for Koyomi to force an affirmative response. Then, an overjoyed Karen lunges towards him and delivers a bone-crushing hug, thanking Koyomi for his response. Koyomi finds her rather restraining hug creepy, but Karen never let go of him, and even declares that she will love her older brother. Koyomi refuses her younger sister's show of love, and soon mentions Suruga Kanbaru.\nSuddenly, Karen lets go of her embrace and steps back, only to perform a dogeza in front of her older brother. There, she pleads to Koyomi to introduce her to Kanbaru. Koyomi is rather surprised that Karen knows Kanbaru by name although he hasn't introduced her to his younger sister, but then assumes that both of them know each other as fellow athletes. Meanwhile, Karen continues to plead to Koyomi, and is even willing to sacrifice her virginity to Koyomi, but he flatly refuses, kicking her lowered head in the process.\nKaren flies across the room and into Koyomi's bed, performing a perfect landing befitting of an Olympic gold medal.\n\nKoyomi soon talks about Karen's rather different personality at home compared to school and outside in general, and Karen replies by saying that she has a reputation of sorts to maintain, thus her change of personality at home. Karen then comments about how her clothes, which are actually stolen from her sister Tsukihi, are rather uncomfortable, but allows her to perform kicks easily.\nMeanwhile, Koyomi asks Karen about how she learned about his connection with Suruga Kanbaru. Karen reveals that the official newsletter of Kanbaru's \"official\" fan club released pictures of their idol having a good time with Koyomi, much to Koyomi's shock, although Karen saw him and Kanbaru's relationship as that of a mentor-student relationship.\nSoon, Karen requests Koyomi once again to introduce her to Suruga, but Koyomi continues to refuse her proposal, as he knows Suruga's sexual preference and probably wants to avoid a scenario that involves said sexual preference. Karen ends up resorting to violence to force Koyomi to give in to her demands, but he still refused, even with Karen's hand embedded deep inside his stomach.\nKoyomi decides to settle their argument once and for all, and this time, the winner of the argument would be determined through a game whose rules are to be dictated by none other than Koyomi himself.\nAs Karen steels herself for any obstacle Koyomi has prepared for her, Koyomi steps out of a room...\n\n...and returns with Karen's toothbrush on his hand.\nKaren shudders at the thought of having that shoved into her butt, but Koyomi assures her that he has other ideas. He reminds Karen that a person often allows only those whom they are familiar with to touch their hair, and he thinks that another activity that carries the same idea is brushing one's teeth, and a person can only tolerate so much of an unfamiliar person touching his/her hair or brushing his/her teeth before that person gives up. Thus, the game involves a test of Karen's psychological tolerance.\nFive minutes of Koyomi brushing Karen's teeth is all it takes for Karen to get her chance to meet Kanbaru personally.\nInitially, Karen finds Koyomi's \"challenge\" too easy, especially since Koyomi is no stranger to her, and is even disappointed about Koyomi's decision. Meanwhile, Koyomi simply prepares the start of his introduction to Suruga Kanbaru's fetishism.\nAs soon as Koyomi places the toothbrush into Karen's mouth, the simple activity of having one's teeth brushed becomes an orgasmic experience. Karen's body becomes jittery as her toothbrush explores every nook and cranny of her mouth, while Koyomi triumphantly grins at the sight of Karen's tolerance being broken down at each brush stroke.\nOne minute has passed, and Karen is close to breaking point, but Koyomi persists on. However, even he is slowly feeling the pressure as seeing Karen in an embarrassing situation is slowly having an effect on him.\nSoon, the pressure becomes too much for Koyomi. As he continues to violate Karen's mouth with her toothbrush, she pushes back Karen, positions himself on top of her, and is just inches away from grabbing her breasts...\n\nThen, Tsukihi appears. Fear overwhelms the two elder siblings.\nAs Karen and Koyomi, both pale-faced, try to explain themselves to Tsukihi, the youngest of the Araragi siblings. As the two desperately hope for a painless verdict, Tsukihi prepares to go to the convenience store to buy a awl to bore holes into her older siblings.\nWith Tsukihi's interruption, the game draws to a close, and Karen tells Koyomi that more than five minutes have passed since the game has begun. Koyomi helplessly admits his defeat and promises to introduce her to Kanbaru. However, Karen goes quiet, and Koyomi decides to lift her spirits by telling her that she did well.\nThen, Karen, with a flushed face, tells Koyomi that they should continue with the game, since the last one was voided by Tsukihi's interruption.\n\nFollowing that morning, Koyomi and Karen get along together better than before."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Nisemonogatari Episode 09: Tsukihi Phoenix, Part 2","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nisemonogatari_Episode_09:_Tsukihi_Phoenix,_Part_2","toc":["#Synopsis",{"#Characters":["#New_Characters"]},"#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"","#Synopsis":{"link":[],"text":"After successfully evading Tsukihi's onslaught of awls, Koyomi quickly contacts Suruga Kanbaru to set up their meeting with his younger sister Karen. To Koyomi's surprise, it turns out that Suruga's remark about wanting to see Karen wasn't really serious... and that she tells Koyomi that she will be unable to take his sister's virginity. Koyomi snaps at Suruga's intention of doing indecent things to Karen, but Suruga playfully extends her gratitude for the thought of offering her sister to her, much to Koyomi's rage.\nFortunately, Suruga agrees to open her house for a visit of two of the Araragi siblings.\n\nLater, as Karen and Koyomi head to the Kanbaru household, Karen suddenly decides to play a game of rock-paper-scissors with her older brother, and tells him that the loser will carry the winner the rest of the way. Koyomi quickly agrees to play along, much to Karen's amazement, although Koyomi wonders why Karen accepted his response just as quickly.\nKaren decides to go first and puts out her hand just before saying the word \"scissors\", and declares her victory since Koyomi wasn't able to show his hand at the same time as she did. Her reward: a punch straight into the face, especially because she just cheated. Koyomi declares her the loser since she cheated to win, and tells her to carry him on her shoulders instead of her back to intensify her punishment.\nKoyomi is surprised, however, Karen quickly accepted the punishment, telling her older brother that anything lighter than 180 kilos is tolerable for her, much to Koyomi's shock.\nAgain, Koyomi tries to make an alibi to avoid being carried by his younger sister, and notices that her ponytail might get in the way. Nonchalantly, Karen responds to Koyomi's remark by pulling out a key and shearing off her ponytail. Koyomi's jaw drops as Karen disposes of the hair that she has been taking care of since elementary.\nRunning out of options, Koyomi decides to ride on his younger sister's shoulders, but soon ends up sweating hard as he feels that it is too high for him, even though it is merely double his height. Then, Karen remarks that Koyomi's crotch is pressing too hard against her head, making it a bit uncomfortable to move around, and wonders if he could cut off \"that part on his crotch\" to make up some space. Koyomi, instantly shudders at the thought.\nThen, Karen notices that Koyomi's tendency to move around is disturbing her balance, and Koyomi sarcastically apologizes for not having the balance of a giraffe's head. She decides to tell Koyomi to fix his position, putting his head out in front and hooking his legs on her arms. Koyomi quickly follows Karen's instructions, but now complains about Karen's fingers and arms cutting off the circulation from his legs. Karen tells him to bear with it, since she's trying to avoid excessive contact with her sensitive parts throughout the long walk ahead.\nWith that, they proceed to the Kanbaru residence.\n\nOn their way, Koyomi is called by a mysterious lady who perches atop a mailbox, asking about the whereabouts of a certain Eikou Cram School. Although being asked a question, Koyomi is more preoccupied by which of them — the one atop a mailbox or the one riding at the shoulders of his younger sister — is weirder. Soon, the lady introduces herself as Yozuru Kagenui, and calls the Koyomi and Karen \"devil boy\" and \"hornet sister\" respectively, although she throws away the topic since \"it no longer matters\". The lady named Yozuru decides to ask about Eikou Cram School's location once again, and Koyomi takes the chance to ask someone who knows about every single cram school in town: Tsubasa Hanekawa.\nTsubasa, who is in a park of sorts, quickly answers the call. According to her, she is doing some afternoon studying. She soon tells Koyomi that Eikou Cram School should be familiar to him, since it's the very building were Meme Oshino and his constant companion Shinobu lived for some time. With that, Koyomi's conversation with Hanekawa ends, although Hanekawa's message about him going to the Kanbaru Residence frightens him a bit.\nKoyomi quickly explained where Eikou Cram School is to Yozuru, and adds the fact that it has long been out of business. After receiving the information, Yozuru prepares to leave, but not until telling Koyomi to be just as kind to a particular small girl if they happen to see her. She then skips her way from the two, as if avoiding to make contact with the ground.\n\nSoon, Koyomi notices that Karen has been quiet throughout his conversation with Yozuru. After flicking her forehead, he scolds Karen for leaving him behind while dealing with a stranger. Karen soon reveals that she is actually steeling herself the whole time, as she had a feeling that the woman who talked with her older brother is a strong one, basing on how well she can maintain her balance and her observations about her physical form. Using those observations, Karen deduces that Yozuru might be as strong as her mentor, and will be a difficult opponent for the likes of her.\nKoyomi finds Karen's talk about Yozuru's strength as a bit cowardly, but Karen tells him that she has the capability of determining gaps in strength between her and another person, just as long as that person is not evil.\nHowever, even Karen is not sure if this lady named Yozuru is not actually evil.\n\nAfter dropping by Karen to Suruga's house, Koyomi heads back home, where he sees a familiar girl with a large backpack: Mayoi Hachikuji. Koyomi, in fourth wall-breaking contemplation, expects the audience to see him running towards her and rubbing his cheek on her face, but he decides to greet him like a normal person instead.\nUltimately, he did end up sprinting towards her, with the intent of rubbing his cheek on her face and all kinds of indecent stuff he usually does to Mayoi. Then suddenly, a hand comes and grabs Koyomi's leg, causing him to tumble, fall and miss his chance of groping Mayoi. As Koyomi vents his frustration on Shinobu, who is the cause of that momentary accident, Mayoi greets Koyomi — and ends up getting his name wrong again.\nMayoi wonders if Koyomi's wandering around town is his way of giving up on studying or a way for Tsubasa Hanekawa to fall for him, as she has an idea that Koyomi's interest in tutorials half due to Tsubasa breasts and half due to Mayoi's body. Koyomi tries to deny Mayoi's statements, particularly her remark about her body, and he tells Mayoi that he is only interested in her because of her breasts that are a bit big for someone of her age.\nAnd he will take every opportunity to claim those breasts, albeit currently underwhelming, as his.\n\nKoyomi's conversation with Mayoi is soon interrupted when a girl with neon green hair and a pink dress appears, asking for directions to Eikou Cram School, then introduces herself as Yotsugi Ononoki. Koyomi remembers his talk with Yozuru Kagenui earlier and helps her out like she requested to. After a short message of thanks, she leaves.\nAlthough perflexed for a few moments, Koyomi notices something. Yotsugi called Mayoi \"snail girl\" and Yozuru called Karen \"hornet sister\" while both called him \"devil boy\".\nThen, Mayoi remarks that Yotsugi is as strong as her master.\nIn response, Koyomi reminds Mayoi that she has no master."},"#New_Characters":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Nisemonogatari Episode 10: Tsukihi Phoenix, Part 3","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nisemonogatari_Episode_10:_Tsukihi_Phoenix,_Part_3","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"","#Synopsis":{"link":[],"text":"Upon his return to his house, Koyomi is confronted by Shinobu Oshino, the oddity that resides in his shadow. Koyomi assumed that it was something important based on her manner of speech, but he was rather disappointed to find out that Shinobu only wanted to catch up with a 100-yen sale on the town's branch of Mister Donuts. Koyomi decides to get her some donuts before dinner, knowing that she, as a vampire would be weak under the sun. But Shinobu insists that she should come and choose her donuts herself, assuring him that the only thing that she would get from sun exposure would be a nasty sunburn, since she is no longer a \"normal\" vampire.\nThat doesn't mean that she doesn't hate the sun, however.\nKoyomi decides to bring her along, but only if she stays in his shadow during the journey.\nShinobu agrees with the condition and with content in her face, returns to Koyomi's shadow.\n\nKoyomi, on his way downstairs, meets his youngest sister Tsukihi near the living room. Tsukihi notices that Karen, who is currently in Suruga's house, isn't hanging out with her lately, and she soon voices her distinction from Karen as part of the Tsuganoki Second Middle School's Fire Sisters: although she is an advocate of justice, she doesn't have a clear image of justice unlike her older sister. To add, she only believes in the justice that Karen and Koyomi believe in.\nThus, she admits that her justice is a fake.\nTsukihi then reveals to Koyomi that she has been considering disbanding the Fire Sisters team altogether, since she is rather fearful of her future once Karen enters Naoetsu Private High School. Koyomi thinks that it is a good idea, but he rejects Tsukihi's claim that he would end up influencing Karen so much that she would end up bullied as well, pointing out that he is trying to be a helpful and reliable older brother to them.\nThe younger of the Araragi sisters wonder if \"pinning his sister to the ground and erotically playing with its mouth with a toothbrush\" is being helpful.\nSoon, Tsukihi finally declares that she will discuss the future of the Fire Sisters with Karen when the latter returns, and is already thinking of setting up a farewell party for the two of them. Koyomi considers helping out, but Tsukihi quickly reminds him that he is planning to go out before their conversation began. Koyomi soon prepares to leave, telling Tsukihi to stay at home and avoid showing up at the door wearing a revealing dress like a yukata.\nAnd then, Koyomi had a thought.\n\nTo the surprise of the younger of the Fire Sisters, Koyomi pulls off the obi of Tsukihi's yukata and pins her to the ground. While Tsukihi nervously finds herself in an embarrassing situation, Koyomi examines her body, which is perfectly pristine. He asks Tsukihi about the scars that she had before, which he remembered was supposed to be permanent according to the doctors who examined her before. However, Tsukihi simply answers by telling that they have healed away, as most scars do.\nKoyomi decides to stop the inspection, but then cops a feel at Tsukihi's breast, much to the girl's shock, as she contemplates how she, a girl with a stable relationship, maintains a rather unusual one with her brother. Then, as Koyomi prepares to leave once again, Tsukihi grumbles as she clothes herself once again. As Koyomi leaves the house, she tells him to not return home.\nHe refuses, and points out that he will come home... on her heart.\n\nShinobu is overwhelmed at the sight of donuts as she and Koyomi arrive at the town's branch of Mister Donuts, and her hunger is colorfully illustrated by every mouthful of words she speak at Koyomi. Unfortunately for her, she could only get a few out of the dozens displayed at the counter. The two soon agree upon getting five each, and Shinobu's feast soon begins.\nMeanwhile, Koyomi decides to ask about the two ladies whom he encountered earlier — the one who speaks in a Kyoto dialect, and the one who adds \"with a posed look\" in her sentences. Shinobu reveals to Koyomi that the \"posed look girl\" is actually an oddity, and their similarity in names (Yozuru and Yotsugi sharing a character) is a way of \"binding\" an oddity to a non-oddity... the way Meme named her after himself (i.e., they share the surname Oshino). She also reveals that Yotsugi is in fact Yozuru's familiar, or in Japanese terms, a shikigami.\nKoyomi deduces that Yozuru is a specialist just like Meme, but Shinobu refuses to divulge any information about someone respectable as her.\nHowever, she has an idea who would be willing to share some information about her.\nShinobu points to a man dressed in black who is eating donuts behind them, and Koyomi is shocked to find out that it is none other than Deishuu Kaiki.\n\nKoyomi quickly confronts Kaiki about his supposed \"exit from town\" now that he has been caught eating donuts, but Kaiki explains that he still did \"minor business\", and is already preparing to leave, since he did not want to see Koyomi's face again after the losses he committed. Kaiki soon decides to reveal information about the two — at the cost of all but 10,000 yen of Koyomi's cash.\nAccording to Kaiki, Yozuru and Yotsugi are \"ghost busters\" like him, although they are real unlike him. They are an onmyouji-shikigami team, with Yozuru as the onmyouji, and Yotsugi as her familiar. Unfortunately, Kaiki only knows their name and occupation, but he mentions that they are quite respectable in their field.\nAnd they are quite limited, Kaiki tells the two.\nThey specialize in immortal oddities.\n\nUpon their return back home, Koyomi wonders if he and Shinobu are targets of the onmyouji-shikigami team. Shinobu doubts it, since they are much different from immortals. That leaves those who are unknown to Koyomi.\nKoyomi and Shinobu soon reach the Araragi Residence, where Yotsugi and Yozuru are knocking on their house door. Koyomi promptly asks the two whether they have arrived to eliminate them, as a powerful immortal oddity and her servant. Yozuru thinks that they might have been mistaken; the issue with Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade has long been resolved, and Koyomi is a normal human with a few lingering after-effects of becoming a vampire.\nThat leaves the only possibility left.\nAs soon as the annoyed Tsukihi Araragi steps out of the door, Yotsugi transforms her right index finger into a massive battering ram and charges through the front porch and straight into Tsukihi.\nIn an instant, Tsuhiki's entire upper half was gone.\nKoyomi Araragi flew into a violent rage.\nHowever, Yozuru was able to suppress him before he could reach Yotsugi. Yotsugi soon explains that his sister is possessed by an immortal bird, the phoenix, and Koyomi soon realizes this as Tsukihi, who is now completely whole, lies unconscious at the ruins of the front door.\nShinobu soon warns the two specialists of the effects of the chaos they just caused, but Yozuru confidently tells Shinobu that a former vampire like her is incapable of defeating someone like her. In response, Shinobu tells Yozuru that she is still capable of draining away Yotsugi's energy, and she will then be able to defeat her afterwards, although Koyomi sees this as a mere bluff. She then requests the two to retreat for the meantime.\nYozuru decides to \"fall for Shinobu's bluff\" and follow Shinobu's request \"out of respect for her\". However, she warns the two that they would not be considerate next time.\n\nAs the two leave, Koyomi confronts them for their reason for targeting Tsukihi.\nTheir reason is simple: they are the good guys, and the \"fake\" who resides in their house is a bad guy that must be taken care of."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Nisemonogatari Episode 11: Tsukihi Phoenix, Part 4","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nisemonogatari_Episode_11:_Tsukihi_Phoenix,_Part_4","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"","#Synopsis":{"link":[],"text":"Tsukihi, still unconscious, is now lying on the couch in the living room, wearing a new yukata after the one she wore was torn to shreds by Yotsugi Ononoki's attack against her. Meanwhile, Shinobu explains the true nature of the oddity that is now in the body of Tsukihi Araragi.\n\nAccording to Shinobu, the \"ghost busters\" actually lied when they told Koyomi that a phoenix resides in Tsukihi's body. What is currently possessing Tsukihi is the Dying Bird (死出の鳥, Shide no tori), a kind of supernatural cuckoo that reincarnates itself by being reborn as a child in the womb of a mother. Interestingly, the story behind the Dying Bird is similar to that of a phoenix, who at its final moments throws itself into the flames to be reborn once again; in this case, the role of those \"flames\" are given to Tsukihi's — and by extension, Karen and Koyomi's — mother.\nShinobu assures Koyomi that the oddity is generally harmless, and its victim is \"blessed\" with the ability to heal back any wound, cure any illness and live a healthy life until its lifespan is reached.\n\nLater that afternoon, Koyomi tries to make up an alibi about what happened in an attempt for Karen to avoid getting involved in the mess he had with two oddity specialists earlier. Fortunately for him, Karen seems to buy his explanations. As Karen decides to watch over the front porch, Koyomi decides to go upstairs, but not before hearing his sister's reassuring message of her willingness to die for her siblings.\nSoon, Koyomi visits Tsukihi, who is fast asleep at her bedroom, and wonders about her nature as an immortal. Then, he suddenly kisses her on the lips.\nAlmost instantly, Tsukihi explodes in rage as she finds her first kiss stolen by none other than her older brother. Meanwhile, Koyomi is rather relieved to have felt absolutely nothing when he kissed her, and he now understands that Tsukihi truly is his sister.\nKoyomi soon recalls that there was a time when he was an only child, and that he became an older brother to Karen when he was three and Tsukihi was born when Karen was one. Regardless, Koyomi still considers Tsukihi as his little sister. Koyomi then asks Tsukihi to disregard his kiss to her, since they are siblings, and they have said things like \"getting married\" in the past anyway.\nKoyomi leaves her room afterwards, leaving behind a rather confused Tsukihi, who still cannot believe that his brother just stole her first kiss. He then leaves the Araragi residence on his bike, leaving behind Karen to watch over the house.\n\nWith a burst of energy, Koyomi rides his bike across town. Shinobu, his constant companion, asks if he has already decided on his next step. Koyomi tells her that although it might not gain him even a little bit, he will fight Yozuru and Yotsugi for the sake of his sisters, to which Shinobu smiles in relief. Then, she remarks that she likes Tsukihi's name, as it reminds her of the moon (since Tsukihi's name has the character for \"moon\" in it), and she will try to help out as well.\nAfter a bloody exchange has been sealed between them, Koyomi and Shinobu head towards Eikou Cram School, now the turf of Yozuru Kagenui and Yotsugi Ononoki.\nAt the fourth floor, the two sides meet once again after what happened earlier. Yozuru continues to mention Meme's name and habits as if mocking Koyomi's relationship with him, but Koyomi and Shinobu, whose form is very different from her childish form, calmly listen to Yozuru's talk.\nSoon, Yozuru decides set up the rules.\nIt would be an all-out brawl, with Koyomi taking on Yozuru, and Shinobu taking on Yotsugi. Koyomi agrees on this match-up, and so Shinobu and Yotsugi head to the second floor, but not until Yotsugi had her way in insulting Shinobu's age and her supposed gap of power.\nMeanwhile, Koyomi decides to ask Yozuru about her relationship with Meme. As Koyomi mentions Meme's unusual style of clothing, Yozuru comments that there must be something that makes him stay with his aloha shirt style; then, she tells Koyomi that she, Meme and Kaiki were classmates in university. Koyomi is rather shocked to discover that Kaiki is closely related to her.\nAnd another surprise awaits Koyomi. Yozuru was able to pin down Tsukihi's location because of Kaiki as well.\n\nSoon, Yozuru asks if Koyomi's position with his supposedly \"fake\" sister has changed due to that revelation, Koyomi gives a negative response before leaping straight into Yozuru.\nHowever, Yozuru was able to catch him by the wrists, and upon declaring that she has given up on persuading him to do things her way, she decides that the only way to bring him down is through her fists. As Yozuru crushes Koyomi's wrists, she drives her head into Koyomi's like a hammer, breaking through his skull on each strike. Then, a final headbutt drives Koyomi into the wall.\nBut Yozuru has just begun her assault. As she throws Koyomi through several floors up, she asks Koyomi about the implications of his actions... What would happen if Karen finds out that Tsukihi is a fake? How would his mother deal with birthing an oddity? What would Tsukihi do if she knew about her nature?\nAs Koyomi lifelessly hangs by the tree at the top of the ruins of the cram school, Yozuru asks Koyomi once again: What would happen if Tsukihi knows that she is an oddity? To her, someone like Tsukihi is unfit in her current surroundings, and she is tasked with stopping her before she could intervene with the affairs of normal humans.\nYozuru's fist bores into Koyomi's chest and she throws Koyomi several floors down again, only to drive her high-heeled shoes into Koyomi's face, driving him even deeper into the ruined cram school building.\n\nYozuru soon drags the lifeless Koyomi to the second floor of the cram school. When she arrives, she is surprised to find out that Yotsugi is defeated, and Shinobu appears unhurt. Yozuru decides to fight Shinobu in Yotsugi's place, but Shinobu flatly refuses, especially with Koyomi, although badly injured, refusing to concede to either Yozuru's words or her attacks.\nYozuru tells Koyomi that his decisions will matter in the end, but she asks him to leave others away from it. Koyomi disagrees that they are talking about \"other people\" in this situation; he points out that they are talking about his family. And he will do anything for his family, whether it involves lying, deception, troublemaking or anything inherently evil.\nKoyomi points out to Yozuru that she is there to eliminate evil, but he is there to embrace evil, and is even willing to be called the worst person in the world, as long as his sisters are safe.\n\nYozuru soon explains the Concept of Fundamental Good by Mencius. According to this concept, \"humans are born fundamentally good\". However, there is a concept of fundamental evil, formulated by Xunzi, and it is based on simple realism. According to Xunzi's concept, humans are born evil, and their good deeds are a lie, a fake, a form of hypocrisy. And a person has to exert a greater effort to be good.\nShe then remembers a question given by Kaiki in the past, \"Given the real thing and an indistinguishable fake, which is worth more?\" Yozuru considered that the real thing had higher value, while Meme sees both as having equal value. Kaiki's answer: the fake carries a greater value, because in its great efforts to become real, it became more real than the real thing.\nYozuru is quite amused at how Kaiki tackled the question.\n\nSoon, Yozuru throws Yotsugi on her back and prepares to leave, conceding in favor of Koyomi and Shinobu. She felt that the fight is worthless since neither of them had the urge to kill the opposing party. Koyomi returned the sentiment, and says that Yozuru still considered him a human despite the vampire blood in his veins, something that only Meme let him feel.\nFor some reason, being compared to Meme makes Yozuru uncomfortable, and so she decides to end their encounter with something that Meme would never say:\nGoodbye.\n\nKoyomi returns to his house and goes straight to Tsukihi's room, where she awaits his return. Koyomi gives her a one-liner explanation of what just happened to him a while ago, and declares that he will end up fighting monsters again if it is for his sisters' sake in the end, although he tells Tsukihi that he hates them.\nHe then decides to introduce Hitagi to them by the end of summer break.\n\nAfter all of this, he still has a lot of work to do.\nFor now, Koyomi calls it a day."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Nisio Isin","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nisio_Isin","toc":["#Biography","#Monogatari_English_Release_%22About_the_Author%22_Section","#Style",{"#Works":["#Zaregoto_Series","#Ningen_Series","#Sekai_Series","#Mah%C5%8D_Sh%C5%8Djo_Risuka","#JDC_Tribute_Series","#Monogatari_Series","#Katanagatari","#Densetsu_Series","#Boukyaku_Tantei_Series","#Novelizations","#Other_Works","#Manga"]},"#External_Links"],"Description":"Nisio Isin (西尾 維新, Nishio Ishin), frequently written as NisiOisiN to emphasize that his pen name is a palindrome, is a Japanese novelist and manga writer born in 1981.

They managed to escaped with the help of Yotsugi Ononoki.\nThey ended up in the abandoned cram school. Shinobu reveals that during her first visit to Japan, 400 years ago, she saved the local people from a severe drought by accident and was revered as a goddess by them. She then spent the next years living as a goddess in Japan until all the villagers started disappearing mysteriously, until only Shinobu and a demon hunter she befriended remained.\nSoon after, the same being that Koyomi met attacked them and Shinobu barely escaped alive, taking with her the demon hunter's hand by accident, which she used to revive him as a servant of hers just like Koyomi. However, the man blamed her for all that happened and unable to reason with him, Shinobu watched him committing suicide by exposing himself to the sunlight. Since then Shinobu never returned to Japan until six months ago, when she and Koyomi first met.\nAfter Shinobu tells Koyomi her story, they realize that Yotsugi was overhearing their entire conversation and after Mayoi awakens, they start discussing ways to deal with the darkness being before it appears before them. Koyomi, Mayoi and Yotsugi manage to escape again, but Koyomi is knocked out cold by the shock of Yotsugi's jumping just to awaken several hours later and learn that they unwillingly left Shinobu behind.\nAs Koyomi's vampire powers had not disappeared yet, they conclude that Shinobu is still alive but with Koyomi's powers weakening, it means that they have to find her before she is killed for good. Having no clue about what to do, they decide to contact Izuko Gaen who might provide some advice and when they decide to take shelter in a house, Izuko herself opens the door for them, much to their surprise.\nIn exchange for her help, Koyomi listened to Gaen's three requests. After Koyomi accepts, Gaen shows the darkness' true motive - it is a manifestation of the natural order, and means to destroy apparitions not behaving as they should—in this case, not Shinobu, but Mayoi. She exposes Mayoi as a \"ghost of a ghost\", who should have passed on Mother's Day, when she finally found her way home; she also stopped leading people astray, neglecting her duty as a lost cow.\nGaen leaves to allow Koyomi and Mayoi to process this, and Mayoi realizes she has to pass on, rather than be eaten by the darkness. Bidding Koyomi farewell, she kisses him and confesses her love for him before vanishing. Four months later, Koyomi tells the story of the incident to only one person - Ougi Oshino.

However, Araragi reveals that if she is disgusted by his martyrdom, then she can have no complaints -- since saving Ougi Oshino is an extension of protecting Koyomi Araragi.\nUnderstanding his motivation, Ougi seals Araragi's wound and announces that their circumstances have changed to a \"lover's suicide.\" Fortunately, Meme Oshino appears at the door with an exhausted Tsubasa Hanekawa. Oshino mocks Araragi for shoving his \"niece,\" acknowledging Ougi's lie that she was his family member, which disperses the darkness.

In Hanamonogatari (Suruga Devil), Suruga refers to Ougi as 'Ougi-kun', 'he', 'this guy', and 'the boy'. When Suruga asks about it, Ougi tells Suruga that they have always been a boy since they were born, though later Ougi says \"Whoops, that's right. I'm a boy now\". It's likely that either Ougi, as an oddity, is able to change their body at will, or rather Ougi is just dressing up as a boy, imitating Koyomi while helping Suruga.\nThe music that plays when Ougi is first shown is called まがいものそのものの女. Translated, this means something along the lines of 'The woman who was the fake/sham itself'. This namesake eventually becomes wildly appropriate as it is revealed that Ougi is an apparition whose entire personal identity is a fabrication, from their behavior and responsibilities, to their name and relationships.\nOugi's first name uses the kanji for \"Fan\" (扇), which is referenced in the cover artwork for the first volume of Owarimonogatari. The significance of Ougi's name is related to the design of astronomical cartography, as maps of outer space are drawn in a fan-like pattern--which relates to their fabricated identity as a person who upholds rules and order in the universe. Likewise, when they were first introduced to Koyomi Araragi by Suruga Kanbaru, they were explained as being a \"fan\" of Suruga's basketball.\nThis is later revealed to be a red-herring in a flash-text at the end of Owarimonogatari's third episode, where Koyomi Realizes that Ougi named themselves by putting a door kanji (戸) over \"hane\" (羽) representing closer to Hanekawa's case, as Ougi's first formal appearance only happens after Tsubasa Tiger.\nOugi's traits, character quirks and design and behavior seems to be based on the Carl Jung's Shadow Archetype. The reveal in Ougi Dark seems to support this.\n\"Spooky Ougi\" is a common in-joke nickname for Ougi in the western community. The name is a reference to an internet picture depicting a Cat Soup styled Ougi from Owarimonogatari as \"The Spooky Ougi of Cute\"."},"#Appears_In":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Ougimonogatari","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Ougimonogatari","toc":["#Etymology","#Synopsis","#Plot","#Introduced_Characters"],"Description":"Ougimonogatari (扇物語) is the 21st part of the Monogatari Series.

Ougi wants to talk to him regarding Oddity related matters. Ougi\nshows Araragi a map that she drew of Naoetsu High School. She points out that\nthere is a room that should exist according to her map, but she can't find the\nroom in the actual school. Believeing it to be Oddity-related, Ougi wants Araragi to help her investigate. When\nthe two reach the place indicated on the map, they find that there is a\nclassroom. They enter the room, but then realize that they are unable to get\nout. Ougi tries to break the window to get out, but she is unable to damage\nanything in the classroom. While they are trying to figure out how to escape,\nAraragi pulls out a notebook from the desk that he is sitting in, and notices\nthat it has his name, \"Araragi Koyomi, first year\" on it, with his\nown handwriting. He then realizes that this classroom looks exactly like the\none he was in during his freshman year. This causes him to remember a tragedy\nthat happened in this classroom, an event that caused him to believe that\nhaving friends will make one weaker, therefore making him antisocial throughout high school until the\nevents of Kizumonogatari. Ougi becomes very curious about his past so Araragi\ndecides to tell her this past event.\nTwo years ago, during his freshman year,\nwhen Araragi was about to leave school, he was stopped by his classmates. His\nclassmates told him that the entire class has a mandatory meeting that day so\nhe had to go back in his classroom. Once back in the class, Araragi is\nconfronted with the class rep, Oikura Sodachi. Oikura has an unnatural hatred\ntowards Araragi, and Araragi has always thought that it was because he was\nbetter at math than she was. Oikura as class rep organized this meeting because\nshe suspected that someone was cheating during the last math exam. Before the\nmath exam, Oikura organized a study session to help her classmates prepare for the\nexam, and about half the class attended. After the test scores for the exam\nwere posted, Oikura realized that those who attended the study session scored\nunusually higher than those who did not, which caused her to suspect that\nsomeone leaked the actual test questions to everyone in the study session.\nTherefore, Oikura organized the after school class meeting in order to\ndetermine who the culprit was, and she didn't allow anyone to leave until then.\nAccording to Araragi, they couldn't\ndetermine the real culprit back then, and the meeting ended in the worst way possible. Ougi\nrealizes that they are currently in a very similar situation. She suggests that\nmaybe just like back then, they can't leave the classroom either until they\nfind the culprit who cheated on the test. However, They need\nto find the actual culprit, and not the culprit that was determined back then,\nin order to escape the room. Araragi tries to recollect the incident in detail\nin order to obtain more clues to solve this mystery. During the event, the\nclass made Araragi the jury since he had the least amount of relationship with\nhis classmates and therefore had the least bias. The class tried to determine\nthe culprit by writing down who attended the study session, and which math\nproblems covered in the study session overlapped with those on the actual exam.\nBut in the end, no one was able to provide any convincing evidence about who\ncheated, and the discussion became increasingly chaotic. Everyone started to\naccuse each other of cheating, and the argument only escalated with time.\nLooking at this utter chaos, Araragi realized that it was impossible to have a\nproductive discussion any more. He turned to Oikura for help, and tried to\nconvince her to end the meeting since it was obviously not going anywhere. Oikura,\nhowever, replied with \"I despise you\", and told the entire class\nabout her final solution. Oikura decided to have everyone \"vote\"\nfor who the cheater is. The student's name was called one by one, and the class\nvoted by raising their hands. Araragi thought this was the worst solution\npossible.When Araragi's name was called, only Oikura raised her hand. Araragi,\nwho did not attend the study session, had scored a perfect 100 on this test,\nwhile Oikura scored 99. This led Oikura to suspect Araragi to be culprit, but\neveryone knew about Araragi's strength in math despite his weakness in every\nother subject. However, when it was Oikura's turn, roughly half the class\nraised their hands. Oikura was therefore deemed as the culprit. She has not\ngone to school since. The fact that everyone voted for Oikura caused Araragi to\nlose faith in friends and relationships in general. Oikura was the one who\norganized the study session as well as the class meeting for the sake of her\nclass, and she was betrayed by her own classmates. It also caused Araragi to\nrealize that anything, no matter how horrible, can be turned into justice by a majority vote.\nAfter finishing his story, Araragi\nis still stuck with the problem of figuring out the real culprit so that he and\nOugi can leave the classroom. Ougi, however, tells Araragi that she already knows who\nthe real culprit is. Ougi also claims that Araragi himself already knows who the\nreal culprit is, and he has been unconsciously protecting that person. Ougi\nreveals that the real culprit is the homeroom teacher, who was also present\nduring the class meeting. Araragi never mentioned her as his teacher and talked\nabout her as if she were a student in his story because he was unconsciously\ntrying to protect her. The homeroom teacher, who was also the math teacher,\nhelped clean up the classroom the day after the study session so he saw what\nmath problems were written on the blackboard. In order to raise her class\naverage so that she can better her reputation as a teacher, she decided to\ninclude some of the math problems she saw on her exam. It is revealed that what\ndisappointed Araragi the most was not because Oikura was voted as the culprit,\nbut because his teacher herself also voted for Oikura. After solving the\nmystery, Araragi and Ougi are able to leave the room. The entire room seemed to\nhave been an illusion since that room is never seen again. The next day,\nAraragi is about to enter his classroom but is stopped by Hanekawa Tsubasa.\nHanekawa tells him that Oikura Sodachi is in the classroom. It turns out that\nOikura is in the same class as Araragi, but Oikura had been absent from school\nuntil now so Araragi did not know."},"#Sodachi_Riddle":{"link":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem"],"text":"Oikura comes to school after a two\nyear absence. Araragi carefully enters his classroom to find Oikura sitting on\nhis seat. Araragi tries to start up a cheerful conversation with her, but finds\nthat Oikura still despises him. In fact, Oikura's hatred for Araragi seems to\nhave grown even more, almost to the level of insanity. Oikura tells Araragi\nthat she hates a person who is happy, but doesn't appreciate the people who\nhelped him become happy, just like a water that thinks it can boil by itself with no\noutside help. Oikura mentions Araragi's shoe locker back in 7th grade, and\nAraragi is confused as to what she is talking about. Oikura's words become\nincreasingly hostile, and Araragi tries to calm her down. Oikura retaliates by\nstabbing Araragi's hand with a pen. This is seen by Senjougahara Hitagi, who\nhas just entered the classroom. Senjougahara furiously confronts Oikura, and\nthey start fighting. Oikura slaps Senjougahara, and Senjougahara knocks Oikura\nunconscious.\nThe next day, both Oikura and\nSenjougahara are absent from school. In order to find out why Oikura hates him\nso much, Araragi decides to follow the only clue Oikura provided, \"shoe\nlocker in 7th grade\". Ougi accompanies Araragi to the middle school that\nhe used to attend. They find the shoe locker that used to belong to Araragi.\nOugi opens the locker, and finds three envelopes addressed to Araragi, labeled\na, b, and c, respectively. As soon as Araragi sees the letters, he remembers an\nevent back in 7th grade that he had forgotten all about, an event that made him\nlike mathematics. The envelope labeled \"a\" says, \"b is wrong, Do\nyour want to change your choice to c?\" Araragi knows that this is the Monty Hall problem, where changing your choice from \"a\" to \"c\" in\nthis situation is statistically better than sticking to your original choice of\n\"a\". The \"b\" envelope is empty, while the \"c\" envelope has a map that leads them to an\nabandoned house. Araragi then tells Ougi about the story involving this house,\nwhich he used to call the haunted house.\n5 years ago when he just entered middle school\nas 7th grade, he was behind in school. Classes suddenly got harder for\nAraragi, and he was especially struggling in math. One day during the summer he\nfound three envelopes in his locker. Opening all three envelopes, he found the\nmap in the \"c\" envelope, and went to the same abandoned house. A girl\nabout Araragi's age came out of the house, and she invited him inside to learn\nmathematics together. In the house the girl explained to him about the logic of\nthe Monty Hall problem and what the letters meant. Araragi became excited\nabout this problem, and for the first time in his life he thought learning math\nwas fun. The girl told Araragi she could teach him about interesting\nmathematical problems like this everyday. So from that day on, Araragi came to\nthe abandoned house everyday to learn math from the girl. Oikura agreed to\nteach him math on several conditions. One was to never ask her name, and one\nwas to never stop loving math. She never asked for anything in return, and she also\ntold Araragi to not tell anyone about their meeting. However, one day, towards\nthe end of summer break, he came to the abandoned house, but the girl never came. Araragi only found an envelope taped to the bottom of the study\ntable, and the envelope was empty. From that day on, he never saw the girl\nagain.\nAraragi realizes now that the girl\nback then was Oikura. She was the reason Araragi is good at math. He forgot\nabout who made him who he is, and he also failed to recognize Oikura when he\nmet her again in freshman year of high school. However, he still didn't\nunderstand why she suddenly disappeared in 7th grade and why she was in an\nabandoned house. At this point, Ougi helps Araragi reveal the truth. She\nsuggests that Araragi's memory is distorted, and what looks like an abandoned\nhouse now wasn't an abandoned house back then. What Araragi thought was an\nabandoned house was actually Oikura's home. It looked abandoned because the\nhouse was in poor condition, with broken windows and furnitures. Ougi deduced\nthat the reason why the house looked so abused despite people living there was\nbecause domestic violence was taking place in the house. Oikura at the time\ndidn't want anything in return from Araragi, but Ougi reveals that it was a\nlie. In fact, Oikura desperately wanted help from Araragi to solve her parents'\ndomestic violence. The reason Oikura chose Araragi was because she knew both of\nAraragi's parents were police officers. By inviting Araragi over to her house,\nOikura hoped that he would report the poor condition of the home to his\nparents. Oikura told Araragi not to tell anyone about their meeting because she\ndidn't want to be responsible for separating her parents. She wanted Araragi to\ntake action himself. Araragi, however, took Oikura's words to heart, and so he\nnever told anyone. He completely believed that Oikura wanted him to learn\nmath, and had no ulterior motive. Ougi suggests that the reason Oikura suddenly\nleft at the end of summer was probably because her family condition reached a\nbreaking point, and they had to move.\nAraragi finally begins to realize\nthe reasons for Oikura's hatred. Oikura was desperately hoping for Araragi to\nhelp her, but Araragi's inaction and foolishness was a complete disappointment\nfor her. In the end, Araragi gained the talent for mathematics, and Oikura\ngained nothing. After this revelation, Araragi decides to apologize to Oikura."},"#Sodachi_Lost":{"link":[],"text":"It has been three days since the\nfight between Oikura and Senjougahara, and neither of them have still come to\nschool.

Hanekawa\nbecomes rather suspicious about Oshino Ougi, and wonders why she seems so\nclose to Araragi. Araragi is about to head to Oikura's home when he is met by\nOugi. Ougi attempts to accompany Araragi but is stopped by Hanekawa. Still\nsuspicious of Ougi, Hanekawa decides to accompany Araragi instead of visiting\nSenjougahara. At Oikura's apartment, Araragi tries to apologize to her, but\nOikura is still unforgiving. Oikura tells Araragi and Hanekawa about her past.\nOikura reveals that it was her father who physically abused her mother. After\nOikura moved during 7th grade, her parents divorced, and Oikura was left to\nlive with her mother. Devastated by the divorce, Oikura's mother locked herself\nin her room and refused to go outside or eat. Oikura therefore had to take care\nof her mother and the house, living off of government assistance. However, she\nwas too young to take care of household chores so trash kept piling up.

After that, the government provided her with a new home, and she\nstarted attending Naoetsu High School, meeting Araragi again as a high school freshman.\nEven now she has no idea where her mother is. Oikura says that even though\nAraragi isn't really to blame for her family condition, it was easier to direct\nher hatred and blame towards him. After some discussion, Oikura doesn't seem to despise\nAraragi as much any more. Before Araragi and Hanekawa leave, Oikura asks them\nto find her mother. She promises to come to\nclass again, and even apologize to Senjougahara, if they can find her mother.\nAfter leaving Oikura's home, Araragi\nand Hanekawa discusses where Oikura's mother may be. Hanekawa is curious about\nthe fact that the day the mother disappeared, both the front door and the\nmother's room were locked. She finds it strange that a person who is about to\nrun away from home will lock her own room. While the two are talking, Ougi\nappears. Ougi claims to know the answer, and mocks Hanekawa for still not figuring it out.\nOugi tells Araragi that he should have brought her along instead of Hanekawa.\nOugi agrees to reveal the answer if Hanekawa can apologize for \"stealing\"\nAraragi from her. At this moment Hanekawa also realizes the answer, and then\ntells Araragi that it is better if Oikura doesn't find out about where her\nmother is. After getting hints from both Ougi and Hanekawa, Araragi finally\nfinds out the truth as well. It turns out that it meant very literally when\nOikura said her mother refused to eat. Her mother refused to eat until she\nstarved herself to death. Because of Oikura's psychological problems she didn't\nrealize that her mother has died. Oikura had been living and \"taking\ncare\" of her mother's corpse for two years. She didn't notice the smell of\na decaying body because it was covered by the smell of trash that had been piling\nup in the house. Oikura came home one day and couldn't find her mother not because\nher mother left home, but because in a period of two years, her mother's body\nrotted until it completely disintegrated. Despite learning this horrible truth, Araragi\nstill decides to go and tell Oikura, much to Hanekawa and Ougi's surprise. After\nAraragi told Oikura about the truth, Oikura took it surprisingly well. Oikura\nseems to have suspected this possibility. In the end Oikura appears to\nforgive Araragi. However, Oikura tells him that she still can't come to school any more.\nThe government can't provide her anymore support for her to live in the current\nhome so she has to move again. The next day, Araragi finds out that Oikura\napologized to Senjougahara in the end. He also finds a letter from Oikura under\nhis desk.

Following Gaen's request, Araragi reluctantly contacts Kanbaru and\nasks her to meet him at the abandoned Eikou cram school building at night.\nAraragi and Oshino Shinobu's pairing had been severed from the events of\nShinobu Time. The pairing still hasn't been recovered, and Shinobu is still\nmissing. While Araragi and Kanbaru are talking in the building, a figure in\nfull samurai armor appears before them. Kanbaru attacks the armor with her\nMonkey's Paw, breaking it into pieces, which reveals that the armor is\ncompletely empty. The armor quickly reassembles itself. Kanbaru tries to attack\nit again, but the armor uses Energy Drain on her. With Kanbaru weakened, the\narmor approaches Araragi, and attempts to strangle him. Araragi is saved by a\nsudden pillar of fire, which causes the armor to release him, (this pillar of\nfire is created by Kako, the tiger Oddity that Hanekawa Tsubasa created in Tsubasa Tiger). Before disappearing, the armor talks to Araragi, saying that it\nwants the Kokorowatari back from Kiss-shot. Araragi tries to escape the building\nwith Kanbaru, but both of them have been weakened by the fight, and pillars of\nfire are blocking all the exits. They are finally saved by Yotsugi Ononoki.\nAfter escaping from the building, Araragi and Kanbaru head for the park,\nwhere they are supposed to meet Gaen Izuko. They arrive at the park, and find\nthat no one is there. However, they find the missing Shinobu. Shinobu explains\nthat she was fighting against a monkey Oddity earlier with the help of Black Hanekawa. They struggled until Ononoki appeared and used Unlimited Rulebook to destroy the right side of the Oddity's body.\nAs Araragi and Shinobu are talking, the monkey Oddity comes back. Its form has\nchanged into a half-monkey, half-crab monster with a tail of a snake. Araragi\nand the others are able to defeat it with the help of Kokorowatari. They then\nfind a message left by Gaen, saying that the meeting place has changed to the\nKitashirahebi Shrine. On the way to the shrine, Araragi explains what happened\nin the cram school building to Shinobu, and asks Shinobu if it is possible that\nthe samurai armor he saw is Shinobu's first vampire servant. Shinobu denies the\npossibility, because she saw with her own eyes how her servant committed suicide by stepping into the\nsunlight.\nWhen they reach the shrine, they finally meet Gaen. Gaen explains to them\nthe identity of the samurai armor. She reveals that the armor really is the\nresurrected first servant of Shinobu from 400 years ago. After the first\nservant, or the first Oddity-slayer, was burned to ashes by the sunlight, he\nnever quite died since vampires are immortal. His ashes drifted through the air\nfor 400 years until they all gathered inside the Kitashirahebi Shrine 15 years\nago. The ashes settled there because that was his home village when he was\nstill human. Because the first Oddity-slayer was such a powerful Oddity, it\nattracted other Oddity to the shrine, which gave rise to the high occurrences\nOddity that Araragi had encountered. The Oddity-slayer in turn fed on the Oddity\nattracted to the shrine, and he slowly regained his power. Gaen speculates that\nthe reason Shinobu as Kiss-shot came to Araragi's town in the first place was\nbecause she was unconsciously attracted to her former servant. Oddity-slayer’s\nrecovery was hindered by the paper charm that Meme Oshino asked Araragi to\nstick on the shrine during the events of Nadeko Snake. However, when Araragi and Shinobu went to the shrine during Mayoi Jiangshi, the Oddity-slayer \"saw\" Shinobu, and his resurrection quickly accelerated. Now the Oddity-slayer has\nbecome powerful enough to take material form. Gaen plans to eliminate him\nbefore he gains back his full power, which is why she needs help from Araragi and\nKanbaru.\nGaen then leaves the shrine to meet up with a professional that she hired to\nhelp fight the Oddity-slayer. Araragi leaves as well to buy food and run some errands,\nleaving Shinobu and Kanbaru behind. At a bookstore, Araragi meets the first\nOddity-slayer (the samurai armor) in the form of a boy. The Oddity-slayer wants to\nhave a heart-to-heart talk with Araragi, so they leave the bookstore. The\nOddity-slayer seems to mean Araragi no harm, and even hands him a bottle of tea. While\nhe was recovering in the shrine for the past 15 years, he has most knowledge of\nall Oddity related events that took place in this town. The Oddity-slayer wants\nAraragi to leave Shinobu, and let him replace Araragi as Shinobu’s\nservant. He claims to regret what he had done in the past, and he wants to\napologize to Shinobu and be with her again. Araragi doesn’t believe his\nintentions, and thinks that he just wants revenge. Oddity-slayer says he is a\nmuch more qualified partner for Shinobu than Araragi. While thinking about how\nto argue back, Araragi decides to take sip of the tea he was given. Before his\nmouth can touch the bottle, a giant cross flies in front of him, destroying the\nbottle. Araragi turns to find that it was the vampire hunter Episode that threw\nthe giant cross. He was the professional Gaen hired. Episode says that the tea was\nactually holy water, which would have been lethal even to Araragi who has miniscule\nvampire trait. Gaen also arrives at the scene, and the Oddity-slayer retreats.\nBefore he escapes, Oddity-slayer challenges Araragi to a duel, and whoever wins\nwill be the rightful partner for Shinobu.\nGaen and Episode leaves to track down the Oddity-slayer, while Araragi goes\nback to the shrine by himself. At the shrine, he meets Ononoki, who is\neavesdropping on a conversation between Shinobu and Kanbaru. Araragi is surprised\nto find out that the two are arguing. Kanbaru suggests Shinobu should meet and\ntalk to the Oddity-slayer, while Shinobu furiously refuses. Shinobu claims it is\ntoo late for reconciliation, while Kanbaru argues that Shinobu is too afraid to\nmeet her past and face her first servant. Shinobu is afraid that she will\nchoose the Oddity-slayer over Araragi. Kanbaru tells Shinobu that she can't run\naway from the problem. Araragi realizes that the relationship between Shinobu\nand Oddity-slayer is similar to situation with Senjougahara and Kanbaru described\nin Suruga Monkey. Therefore, Kanbaru understands Oddity-slayer's feelings better than anyone else. Upset, Shinobu locks herself inside the shrine.\nGaen and Episode arrives at the shrine, and explains the details of the duel\ntonight. As a former Oddity expert himself, the Oddity-slayer agrees to let\nGaen set the rules of the duel. Episode was originally going to duel the\nOddity-slayer since he has a better chance of winning. However, Araragi wants to\nface Oddity-slayer by himself for Shinobu’s sake. Episode is fine either way, and tells him\nthat he doesn’t need to win the duel, since Gaen and Episode will be able\nto defeat the Oddity-slayer afterwards. Araragi just needs to make sure he doesn’t\ndie from the duel; otherwise Shinobu will reawaken her powers as Kiss-shot. The\nlocation of the duel will be the Naoetsu High School ground, the same place\nAraragi fought the vampire hunters in Koyomi Vamp.\nAt the night of the duel, Araragi, Kanbaru, Gaen and Episode arrive at the\nschool ground. Shinobu still refused to come out of the shrine, and the pairing\nstill hasn’t been recovered, so Araragi has to fight without any vampire\npowers. Oddity-slayer arrives in his samurai armor form, and Gaen explains the\nrules of the duel. Gaen sticks a shinai into the ground, and has Oddity-slayer\nand Araragi to stand beside it. Then the two will walk 10 steps in opposite\ndirections. At the 10th step, they will run back towards the shinai.\nWhoever can grab the shinai and strike the opponents body with it, (similarly\nto kendo), will win. Gaen figures using a shinai will minimize the chance that\nAraragi will die from the duel. Before they begin, Araragi receives a mail from\nHanekawa Tsubasa. This is the same night that Hanekawa will face Kako the\ntiger, so she wanted Araragi’s help. Only then does Araragi find out that\nHanekawa is in danger. Gaen adds that Senjougahara is in danger as well, since\nKako will burn down her home just like it burned down Hanekawa’s home and the\ncram school building. Gaen says Araragi can abandon this duel and let Episode\ntake his place so that he can go help Hanekawa and Senjougahara. Araragi,\nhowever, sticks to the duel and has Kanbaru run off to warn Senjougahara.\nThe duel is about to begin, and suddenly, Kokorowatari falls down from the\nsky, and splits the shinai in half. Araragi realizes that it was Shinobu who threw it, but\nshe doesn’t show her face. Oddity-slayer doesn’t understand why Shinobu doesn’t\nwant to see him. Gaen is surprised, but suggested that they have no choice but\nto use the Kokorowatari as the weapon instead, making the stakes of the duel\nmuch higher. The duel finally begins, and Araragi and Oddity-slayer takes their\n10 steps. After the 10th step, Araragi turns around to run for the\nKokorowatari, when he realizes that the Oddity-slayer has taken off all the armor\nin order to run faster. The Oddity-slayer gets to the Kokorowatari first, and he\nprepares to cut down Araragi. Araragi quickly latches on to Oddity-slayer’s body,\nand sticks on him Meme’s paper charm that he peeled off of the shrine.\nOddity-slayer quickly disintegrates, and all the Oddity he had been absorbing over\nthe years disperses. Oddity-slayer screams out Kiss-shot’s name, and only then\ndoes Araragi realize that the Oddity-slayer truly cared for Shinobu, and wanted\nto see her again. The Oddity-slayer eventually loses his ability to speak, and\nShinobu finally shows herself. She apologizes to the Oddity-slayer, and calls out his\nreal name, Seishirou, (Seishi means life and death). Crying, Shinobu devours the\nOddity-slayer, and all the Oddity that made him up. Once everything is\nresolved, Araragi is presumed to have gone to help Hanekawa as described at the\nend of Tsubasa Tiger. At the end of the story, Ougi asks Araragi whether Shinobu also devoured the armor that\nSeishirou took off during the duel, but Araragi doesn't remember. Ougi suggests that the armor can be used\nto forge another replica of Kokorowatari and even Yumewatari. It is the morning\nof the college entrance exam, and after Ougi leaves, Araragi heads for school."},"#Volume_3":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Mayoi_Hell":{"link":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Av%C4%ABci","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Deishuu_Kaiki","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tadatsuru_Teori","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsukimonogatari"],"text":"Araragi heads for school to take the college entrance exam. Before going to\nschool, he visits the Kitashirahebi Shrine, hoping to meet Kagenui Yozuru. Kagenui has been missing for a month. Before he\nknows it, he is standing in front of Hachikuji Mayoi. Araragi is extremely\nhappy to see Hachikuji, but he is also confused since she was supposed have\npassed on to the afterlife after the event of Shinobu Time. Hachikuji explains that this is because Araragi himself is in\nthe afterlife. He is in the lowest level of Hell, Avīci. Araragi\nthen remembers what happened the morning of the college entrance exam. He went\nto the shrine, and saw Gaen Izuko there. Gaen cut him into pieces with the Kokorowatari, killing\nhim. The reason why Araragi went to Hell is because he saved a vampire,\nKiss-shot, back in spring break, which is considered one of the worst crimes. Hachikuji\nis in Hell as well because dying before her parents is also considered a crime punishable in Hell.\nThe sentence for Hachikuji’s crime is very light, so she resides in the\nuppermost level of Hell. Hachikuji came down to Avīci in order to escort\nAraragi, because she knew he would end up here.\nThe Hell currently has the\nappearance of Araragi’s town, and they are in the park. Hachikuji takes Araragi\nto meet someone. On the way, they encounter past events replayed in front of them,\nincluding the injured and bleeding Kiss-shot on the street, the falling\nSenjougahara, and Sengoku Nadeko hastily running down the stairs of\nKitashirahebi Shrine. Seeing these visions and looking back at the people Araragi\nhas helped, he comes to the realization even if he chose not to help those\npeople, another person would have helped them eventually. During spring break, Kiss-shot\ncould have been saved by her former servant Seishirou, who was slowly\nrecovering in the shrine. Senjougahara’s weightlessness would have been solved\nby Kaiki Deishu while he was in town. However, Araragi realizes that despite\nknowing this, he would still have chosen to help those people if he could redo his past.\nThey arrive at a place that appears\nto be the Kitashirahebi Shrine. To Araragi’s surprise, he finds Tadatsuru Teori \nwaiting for them there. Teori was supposedly killed by Ononoki Yotsugi during Yotsugi Doll, but Teori has actually\nbeen dead long before that. After creating Ononoki along with others in the occult\ncircle back in college, Teori was inspired to make himself an Oddity and become immortal. This\nwas a forbidden ritual, and he failed, dying in the process. However the ritual\ndidn’t completely fail and he gained the ability to control “dolls\" from the\nafterworld. The one that Ononoki “killed” was simply one of his dolls. Gaen\nand Teori has been in contact with each other through his doll, and Gaen has\nbeen communicating with Hachikuji through Teori. Teori explains to Araragi that\nGaen killed Araragi with Kokorogatari, and plans to resurrect him with Yumewatari,\nwhile Teori takes out the vampire traits from Araragi. This way, Araragi will\nrevive as a full human.\nEven though Teori had been outside\nof Gaen’s influence, he started to keep in touch with Gaen recently. Some time\nago, Teori was contacted by Oshino Meme. Meme had predicted the various turn of\nevents, so he told Teori that someone might contact Teori to kill Araragi and\nShinobu in the near future. If that ever happens, Meme wanted Teori to set aside\nhis past grudges, and contact Gaen. When Meme’s prediction came true, Teori\ndecided to follow Meme's suggestion. Gaen and Teori decided that it was best to feign\nignorance to avoid raising any suspicions by the “enemy”. So Teori pretended to\nfollow the request to kill Araragi, and got himself, (or rather his doll), “killed”\nby Ononoki on purpose. Only Gaen and Meme knows about this secret. Everything\nwas an intricate plan to defeat the “enemy”.\nA rope comes down from the sky,\nwhich upon closer inspection is a tail of a snake. Gaen has dropped it down to\nHell in order to bring Araragi back to life. As Araragi is being pulled back up, he instinctively grabs Hachikuji,\ndragging her back up as well. Before they leave Hell, Teori reveals to Araragi that\nthe “enemy” they are fighting against is Oshino Ougi. Araragi is back at the\nshrine, and he sees Shinobu in her full Kiss-shot form wrapping her hands around\nGaen’s neck. When Araragi was killed, the pairing between him and Shinobu was\ncompletely severed, causing Shinobu to transform back to her former self.\nShinobu was planning to kill Gaen if Gaen failed to resurrect Araragi. Seeing\nas how Araragi is back safely, she releases Gaen. Gaen is shocked that Araragi\nbrought Hachikuji with him, but she is also glad that he did. Gaen says all of\nthe necessary pieces are set, and she is ready for counterattack. Araragi\nrealizes that less than two minutes have passed since he was sent to Hell, so\nhe heads to school for the college entrance exam."},"#Hitagi_Rendezvous":{"link":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Day"],"text":"Araragi finishes his entrance exam,\nand goes home. He finds Senjougahara waiting for him outside his house.\nSenjougahara wants to go on a major date with him tomorrow. Araragi had been\ntoo busy studying for the exam and dealing with Oddity related problems, that\nthey hadn’t had a date for months, so Senjougahara wants to make up for it. Tomorrow\nis also White Day, a Japanese holiday a occurring one month after Valentine’s\nDay. Araragi agrees, and he goes home to rest after talking with Ononoki\nYotsugi and Araragi Tsukihi.\nThe next day, Araragi goes to\nSenjougahara’s home for the date. To his horror, Senjougahara is holding a car\nkey, and she is planning to go driving with him. Senjougahara reassures him\nthat she already has a license. Araragi is still terrified since high school\nstudents are forbidden to drive. Senjougahara is not worried, and they head out\nin a rental car. While driving, Senjougahara informs Araragi that Hanekawa is\ncoming back tomorrow from her travels in time for their graduation. She also\nsays that Hanekawa may have found out where Oshino Meme is, and will try to bring him back, but Senjougahara\ndidn’t ask for any more details. Their first dating destination is the\nplanetarium. Araragi falls asleep during the program, and Oshino Ougi appears\nin his dream. They talk about constellations and the meaning of what’s right and wrong. Ougi tells Araragi that she is the law of the universe. Araragi wakes up to\nfind that Senjougahara has also dozed off. They leave the planetarium and go to\na science museum. After lunch, they go to play bowling. Senjougahara challenges Araragi to a bowling match, and the loser must obey the winner's order. Araragi has never played bowling before, but he manages to win. Senjougahara bitterly admits defeat. Araragi doesn't want to order Senjougahara to do anything so he settles with asking her a random favor. They then go to afternoon tea, where Araragi explains what happened on the day of the exam. Afterwards they go to sing karaoke. Senjougahara turns on the scoring system, and challenges Araragi to another competition. Whoever has a higher total score in a period of two hours wins, and the loser again must obey the winner's order. Araragi beat Senjougahara by just three points. Araragi is again reluctant about giving Senjougahara orders, so she suggests carrying (bridal carry) her to the car. While they\nare heading home, Araragi apologizes to Senjougahara for not preparing any gifts\nfor her on White Day. Senjougahara doesn’t mind, but she suddenly pretends to be furious\nin order to get him to obey her one order. She wants Araragi to\ncall her by her given name, Hitagi, for the rest of his life. Araragi realizes that Senjougahara challenged him to all those competitions just so that she could make this request. He happily agrees to call her Hitagi,\nand Senjougahara calls him “Koyomi” in return.\nAraragi walks home to find Ougi\nwaiting outside his house. Ougi asks him if he’s figured out the meaning of right\nand wrong. Araragi tells her he still isn’t sure. Ougi asks him to abandon\nHachikuji and Shinobu, but Araragi refuses. Ougi claims that Gaen has set up a\ntrap for Ougi, but she has no choice but to fall for it. She has something she\nneeds to accomplish that is worth dying for. Ougi ends the conversation by\nasking Araragi if he will be on her side and help her."},"#Ougi_Dark":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tooe_Gaen","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Yozuru_Kagenui"],"text":"Araragi and Ononoki go to the Shirohebi\nPark to meet Gaen, Shinobu, and Hachikuji. Gaen reveals her final plan to fight\nOshino Ougi. First she explains the history of this town. This town was\noriginally the village in Japan that Shinobu as Kiss-shot came 400 years ago. The\nvillagers used to worship a snake god residing in the lake. When Kiss-shot\narrived, she accidentally landed right on the village lake, instantly splashing\nevery drop of water out of the lake. This caused the water to rain on the\nentire village, saving the crops from drought, but drying out the lake also killed\nthe original snake god. Even though the villagers worshipped Kiss-shot as the\nnew god of the lake for some time, most of them were devoured by “Darkness”.\nWhen Kiss-shot escaped to South Pole, the village was almost deserted with no\ngod. The survivors wanted a new god, so they adopted a snake god worshipped by\na small number of people living in the mountain. They built a shrine in that\nmountain, and that became Kitashirahebi Shrine. Since the lake has long been\ndried up, the fact that there used to be a god there was slowly forgotten. That\nlake is the location of the present-day Shirohebi Park. The Kitashirahebi\nShrine was destroyed along with its god when the ashes of Seishirou gathered in\nthe shrine.\nGaen says there are two things that\nmust be done; find a new god for the shrine and defeat Ougi. A god is necessary\nin order to keep the peace and repel Oddity in this town, which is why Gaen initially\nwanted Shinobu to become a god after the events of Shinobu Mail. Gaen was still planning to have the fully-powered\nShinobu become the god. However, because Araragi accidentally brought Hachikuji\nfrom Hell, she figured Hachikuji is a much better candidate. Hachikuji is still\nconsidered a ghost, so “Darkness” will attempt to swallow her unless she\nreturns to Hell. If she becomes god, “Darkness” will no longer have any reason\nto attack her. However, Gaen says the real “Darkness” will not attack her, but\nOugi, the “fake Darkness” will, so Ougi must be defeated, which leads into the\nsecond part of Gaen’s plan. According to Gaen, Ougi is an ordinary Oddity who’s\npretending to be “Darkness”. Gaen asks if Araragi is willing to help her defeat\nOugi. Gaen was originally going to defeat Ougi using the Kokorowatari, but only\nway to permanently destroy Ougi is for Araragi to do it himself. Araragi agrees,\nand Gaen reveals to him Ougi’s true identity. Ougi cannot be defeated unless\nher true identity is known. As soon as her identity is exposed, she will become\na Oddity pretending to be something she’s not, and she will be devoured by the\ntrue “Darkness”. Gaen knows how to defeat this type of Oddity because she saw her\nsister, Gaen Tooe (Kanbaru’s mother), meet a similar Oddity.\nBefore Gaen tells Araragi about the\ntrue identity of Ougi, the scene shifts to Araragi Tsukihi. Tsukihi has been\nvisiting Sengoku, and helping her draw manga. On her way home, Tsukihi meets\nOugi, who offers to take her home with bicycle. Instead of taking her home,\nOugi takes her to the abandoned cram school building, which has somehow\nreturned to the state before Tsubasa Tiger. Ougi attempts to tell Tsukihi that she is a Phoenix Oddity, but\nbefore she can do that, she sees Araragi waiting for her in the building. Ougi\nasks Tsukihi to go back home. With Araragi alone with Ougi, Araragi proceeds to\ndefeat Ougi by calling out her true identity. Ougi’s true identity is Araragi\nKoyomi himself.\nThe scene flashes back to the park,\nwhere Gaen reveals that Ougi’s true identity is Araragi Koyomi himself. She is\nan Oddity that Araragi created, similarly to how Hanekawa’s stress created Black\nHanekawa, and Sengoku’s hallucinations created the white snake Kuchinawa. Ougi\nrepresents Araragi’s self-criticism. When Araragi saw \"Darkness\" for\nthe first time in Shinobu Time, he realized that there is a law\ndictating over the world of Oddity. Araragi knows that he is too weak, too\nhesitant, too emotional to make harsh decisions, and he subconsciously wished\nfor a being that can judge him, and \"correct\" everything wrong in\nthis world. His desire came true as Oshino Ougi. This explains why Ougi knows everything\nregarding Araragi, even things that Araragi didn’t tell her, and he meets Ougi everywhere\neven in his dreams. This also explains why Ougi always says, “I don’t know\nanything Araragi-senpai; you do”. Araragi always criticizes himself for his\nshortcomings, and feels like he should be punished for what he’s done. Ougi\nacts as his ultimate critic, and forces him to remember memories that he wants\nto forget, as in Ougi Formula and Sodachi Riddle. Even when Araragi\nconsciously wants Hachikuji to stay in his town, deep under he feels Hachikuji coming back is too\ngood to be true, and he doesn’t deserve it. That is why Ougi will not allow\nHachikuji to become god. The reason Oshino Meme and Kagenui Yozuru are missing\nis because Ougi put up a barrier that prevents them from entering the town. In\naddition Ougi used a Snail Oddity similar to Hachikuji so that they will get lost and\ncannot find their way back home. This is because Araragi feels bad about always\ndepending on Oddity experts to solve his problems. He thinks this is “cheating”.\nGaen, however is able to enter the town because she can cut down the barrier\nwith the Kokorowatari that she forged out of Seishirou’s armor.\nGaen Tooe’s Oddity was also created by\nherself. Tooe had extremely high expectations of herself and those around her. Before\nlong she gained a tendency to lose things. She realized that all the items she\nwas losing had something in common, which were things that were desired but not\nnecessary. Her Oddity was consuming everything that was deemed as distractions in her life. In the end, Tooe was able to identify the Oddity as herself, and gave\nit the name, “Rainy Devil”, before it could devour her friends and boyfriend. Tooe later passed down the remaining arm of the\nRainy Devil to her daughter Kanbaru Suruga. There are several conditions that reinforced\nAraragi’s creation of Ougi. When Araragi first met Seishirou in his samurai\narmor form, Seishirou drained some power from Kanbaru’s Rainy Devil arm, which\ntransferred some of the essence of Tooe’s Oddity into Seishirou. Afterwards,\nSeishirou was devoured by Shinobu, and Rainy Devil was transferred into\nShinobu. Finally, because of the special link between Shinobu and Araragi, some\nof Rainy Devil seeped into Araragi, promoting him to create a similar Oddity. Gaen\nknew what Ougi wanted to do before Araragi’s graduation. Deep down, Araragi\ndoesn’t think it’s right for Tsukihi to live her life without knowing about the\nfact that she is actually an immortal Oddity, so Ougi wanted to expose to Tsukihi\nthe secret about the Phoenix Oddity. Knowing this, Gaen had Araragi wait for Ougi\nat the cram school ahead of time.\nThe scene switches back to the cram\nschool. As soon as Araragi identifies Ougi as a part of himself, the real “Darkness”\nappears, preparing to swallow Ougi. Ougi admits defeat, and claims that Araragi\nhad been right all along. Right when “Darkness” is about to swallow Ougi,\nAraragi runs up, and knocks Ougi over, saving her from “Darkness”. Ougi,\nshowing real emotion for the first time, asks him\nwhy he has the urge to save people every time. Araragi replies by saying he’s\nnot saving someone else. For the first time he’s saving himself, since Ougi is essentially\nhimself. This is the first time Araragi acts out selfishly. Araragi\nwasn’t able to completely dodge “Darkness”, and it sucked away his right arm,\ncausing him to bleed profusely. Ougi is able to stop the bleeding, but there seems\nto be no hope since “Darkness” is just about to swallow them both.\nAt that moment, Oshino Meme arrives at\nthe scene, followed by an exhausted-looking Hanekawa. It turns out Ougi sent\nMeme and Kagenui to the South Pole and North Pole, respectively, where there are\nno Oddities. Hanekawa was able to find Meme in the South Pole and bring him back\nin time. To Araragi, Meme says, “Hey, what are you doing to my dear niece Ougi?\nDid something good happen?” As soon as he says that, “Darkness” disappears. Oshino\nOugi is a fake name and the fact that Ougi is Oshino’s niece is a lie. However,\nsince Meme himself admits that Ougi is his niece, it is no longer considered a “lie”,\nand “Darkness\" disappears. Meme said that on purpose in order to save Ougi and\nAraragi.\nGaen is once again amazed at Araragi’s\nfinal decision, but she deems it acceptable. Hachikuji swallows the snake god\ncharm, and becomes the official god of Kitashirahebi Shrine as planned. Despite\nShinobu getting her powers back, she would still rather go back to her child\nform and have her pairing restored with Araragi again. Therefore, Gaen recovers the pairing\nbetween the two, and Araragi becomes a vampire-hybrid again. The next day,\nAraragi goes to graduation and meets Hachikuji on the way, who is now a god patrolling the town. He then meets Hanekawa at school. When Hanekawa was initially\nlooking for Meme, she was constantly looking in places that Meme would most\nlikely be. Later she realized that her approach had been backwards, and she\nshould look in places where Meme was least likely to be, which was either the\nNorth or South Pole. On the way, they also meet Senjougahara. As they are\nclimbing the stairs, a girl passes by. Araragi asks Senjougahara and Hanekawa\nto get his diploma for him, and runs after the girl. He catches up, and\ncheerfully greets the smiling Oshino Ougi."},"#Illustrations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Anime":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Owarimonogatari_(anime_series)"],"text":"The first two volumes of Owarimonogatari were adapted into anime through a 12 episode series of the same name in Fall 2015.

As he tries to open the door from the inside, Ougi tells him that the doors and windows are also shut tight; both believe that the doors and windows seem to be held in place by glue. Koyomi decides to ask help from Suruga Kanbaru, who knows of his current location, but Ougi begins questioning his dependence on other people. Soon, Ougi changes the topic to the clock inside the room. Koyomi is surprised to see that the clock hasn't moved since he and Ougi entered the classroom.\nHis problem with the locked classroom began on the same day, somewhere during the end of October. Suruga Kanbaru brought a mysterious girl to Koyomi, telling him about the girl asking for advice related to oddities and her relation with Meme Oshino. Soon, the girl, named Ougi Oshino, talked alone with Koyomi about her feelings of suspicion towards the unusually-sized audiovisual room inside the school building of Naoetsu Private High School. Koyomi was puzzled about what Ougi meant. However, his sentiments changed when Ougi suggested that the peculiar size of the audiovisual room may be related to an oddity. His interest piqued by the possible encounter with an oddity, Koyomi headed to the room in question on the third floor, and was eventually locked out with Ougi.\nOugi soon clarifies that she does not have an ample amount of knowledge about oddities unlike her uncle, but suggests that the oddity involved may be related to their current situation. Soon, Koyomi and Ougi talk about the clock that is currently stopped at a few minutes before six and, as Koyomi suffers a dizzy spell after having flashes of memories about experiencing supplementary class before, he goes to a seat in the middle of the classroom. Ougi begins wondering why he chose to sit there, and soon, she thinks that choosing that seat is natural to him.\nEventually, she mentions that the fact that she found a classroom near the audiovisual room when she was accompanied by Koyomi, and she suspects that the classroom is something important to Koyomi. Shortly after, Koyomi's flashes of memory intensifies, leaving himself dazed.\nMoments later, Koyomi finds a textbook with his name on the back, much to his shock, and Ougi soon points to the classroom, where the written date is July 15. From the look on Koyomi's face, she feels that something happened to Koyomi at that date that caused so much resentment that she thinks manifested into an oddity. Koyomi eventually remembers that it was in July 15 when he was put \"under trial\" by his classmates.\nOugi soon reminds Koyomi about the pet phrase he used in the past, \"I don't need friends. If I make friends, my strength as a human decreases,\" and that he stopped using the phrase after meeting Tsubasa Hanekawa. Soon, Ougi becomes curious about what changed Koyomi's personality back then, and she urges Koyomi to talk about it, to which Koyomi soon complies to.\nWhen Koyomi was just a freshman in Naoetsu Private High School, he had a classmate, his class' president named Sodachi Oikura, who wanted to be called \"Euler\", but ends up getting the nickname \"How Much\" because of her tendency to look at people as if appraising them. One afternoon, on July 15, Sodachi held a special class assembly—one that he is not informed of beforehand—whose purpose is to find a certain culprit that is within the class. That particular culprit was the one who allegedly leaked the answers for the final exams after the results have shown a discrepancy of 20 points between those who attended a study group that Sodachi joined and those who did not. Sodachi declares that nobody is allowed to leave the classroom until the culprit, regardless if it attended the study group or not, to confess.\nAfterwards, Koyomi was assigned as the presiding member, and he was chosen because he has attained a score higher than those who attended the study group at a perfect 100. (At this point, Koyomi suggested that his math score was the reason why Sodachi hates him to a psychotic extent.)\nOugi thought that he did something repugnant as narrowing down the culprit to among the 19 people who attended the study group, but Koyomi clarifies that the culprit wasn't determined during the assembly. Because of this, Ougi concludes that the only way to get out of the classroom is to determine the culprit in the incident from two years ago, since it remains to haunt not only the classroom, but Koyomi as well.\nKoyomi soon continues on talking about the class assembly.\nAmong the 19 names who joined the class assembly, someone by the name of Arikure suggested that not all of the ones who went to the study group had high scores, and soon, the five highest scorers, including Hitagi (98), who is also in the class, Sodachi (99), and Koyomi (100), were added to the suspects. Although the other students were slowly presenting their own arguments, Sodachi urged the class to return to finding out the culprit.\nEventually, hours of arguing and bickering began to strain the minds of the entire class, and even Koyomi's calm approach to the commotion was slowly becoming futile. He soon urges Sodachi to do something, forgetting about her hatred towards him, and this compels the class president to speak once again. There, Sodachi shifts the entire issue to a majority vote.\nKoyomi recalls the despair in Sodachi's face when she turns out as the only one who voted against Koyomi. That despair eventually stuck to him, and he eventually becomes unable to make a perfect score in a mathematics exam since then. Koyomi is certain that Sodachi wasn't the culprit because she planned the class assembly in the first place, and the outcome of the assembly was when he lost faith in humanity for being able to dictate what is right and just through sheer numbers. To him back then, the only way was to resort to solitude.\nOugi soon shatters Koyomi's peace of mind as she reminds him that they still cannot leave the classroom without finding out who the culprit is. She feels that Koyomi has to deal with the regret of what happened in the past, which she suggests is the cause of their current dilemma. She also points out that Koyomi already knows the culprit—the one who is supposed to be denounced in the class assembly—and it was the reason why Koyomi had to retell the incident in his own way.\nThen, Ougi decides to reveal the perpetrator: Komichi Tetsujo.\nBased on Koyomi's story, Ougi points out that he remained standing throughout the assembly, suggesting that one other person is with the class: the homeroom teacher, which Ougi also thinks is also a math teacher. Komichi Tetsujou was known to have helped in cleaning the classroom after the study group, and Ougi explains that the homeroom teacher can make the math exam based on the questions used in the study group. Ougi then points out that the reason why the homeroom teacher, Komichi Tetsujou, was the culprit is because the improvement of scores in the exams can be used as a positive evaluation for the teacher.\nOugi then prepares to leave and explains that vampires sometimes have a tendency to be unable to enter or a building unless being authorized to do so. She then dispels Koyomi's worries about her locking him in, and sympathizes with the disappointment of seeing a teacher doing such a dishonest act.\nKoyomi heads for the door, but Ougi demands for one final clarification in the story.\nThere, he explains that among the majority vote against Attendance Number 6, Sodachi Oikura, was the vote of Komichi Tetsujou.\nKoyomi eventually leaves the classroom, just in time for the 6 PM school bell.\nThe next day, Koyomi revisits the \"room\" beside the audiovisual room and does not find an empty classroom where he left the day before. After everything that happened involving the study group and Sodachi Oikura, Komichi Tetsujo remains as a teacher of Naoetsu Private High School, although she was on maternity leave in the present time.\nAs he decides to bring the past behind him, he suddenly stumbles upon Tsubasa Hanekawa. After she pushes away Koyomi from their classroom, Tsubasa begins whispering close about seeing someone who is sitting inside the classroom, someone who has attended school again after a long time.\nIt is Sodachi Oikura, who had stepped into Naoetsu Private High School after spending the past two years in home school, as if using the maternity leave by Komichi Tetsujo as an opportunity to return to school."},"#New_Characters":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Owarimonogatari Episode 03: Sodachi Riddle, Part 1","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Owarimonogatari_Episode_03:_Sodachi_Riddle,_Part_1","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Referbacks","#Cultural_References"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Sodachi Riddle, Part 1\" (そだちリドル 其の壱, Sodachi Ridoru Sono Ichi) is the third episode of the Owarimonogatari anime series.

Although Tsubasa is worried about him, Koyomi tries to assure her, but he becomes unsettled when Tsubasa reveals Sodachi's eagerness about knowing about Koyomi's current condition. Eventually, he decides to deal with Sodachi as Tsubasa informs the faculty about Sodachi's return.\nKoyomi enters the classroom and tries to engage in lively talk with Sodachi. However, Sodachi responds by expressing her jealousy over Koyomi's positive life, as well as her feelings of hate over people who don't appreciate the reasons for their happiness. Moreover, Sodachi voices out her hate for Koyomi. Koyomi tries to act with empathy towards Sodachi, but Sodachi's temper worsens, to the point that Koyomi had to grab her shoulders. Shocked by the sudden contact, Sodachi grabs her pen and stabs it on Koyomi's left hand.\nPained by the injury, Koyomi retreats, only to see Hitagi inside the classroom, with Tsubasa trying and failing to keep her from entering the classroom.\nHitagi comments on someone else hurting Koyomi with stationery, and Sodachi quickly picks up on the fact that Hitagi ended up becoming Koyomi's girlfriend. Sodachi tries to warn Hitagi about Koyomi's lack of consideration, but Hitagi shoves her argument aside, even if Sodachi had taken care of Hitagi when she was still sickly, and she points out that helping Koyomi to reach college is of her own accord, expecting nothing in return.\nSodachi slaps Hitagi in response, and Hitagi answers with a punch that knocked out Sodachi. Koyomi then has to deal with a fake-unconscious Hitagi.\nAfter telling about what happened in the classroom, Koyomi and Ougi visit Nanahyakuichi Public Middle School. There, Koyomi finds a \"relic of the past\", namely three enveloped letters addressed to his middle-school self. Ougi opens one envelope, and the letter inside says that the \"B\" envelope is wrong and asks the reader whether to open the \"C\" envelope or not. Koyomi explains that the envelopes are an example of a Monty Hall problem, and that the problem lies not with the chances of winning the prize, but in the chances of getting the contestant to change its choice.\nOugi eventually chooses the \"C\" envelope, and she finds a map, prompting Koyomi to head to where the map points to, but not before taking a glance at the locker of Nadeko Sengoku.\nThe map brings Koyomi and Ougi to a run-down house, and Ougi breaks inside, certain that they can use the alibi of getting lost to any police officer that finds them. Koyomi warns Ougi that his parents who are also police officers, wouldn't bail out their son in cases like this, adamant about their notion of justice. Soon, Ougi assures Koyomi that Sodachi attending school is a good sign for him because it is a sign that she knew about the real culprit in the class assembly problem. As for Sodachi's sentiments, Koyomi thinks that the hate she harbored against Koyomi has been there for the start, and Ougi explains that Koyomi forgetting about his roots is also responsible.\nAs Koyomi and Ougi argue that the only way to deal with Sodachi is to know more about her, they end up on the attic, where a tea table is found in the middle. Koyomi wonders why he finds himself promptly answering to anything Ougi answers, and he soon begins talking about his past, namely \"what he is made of\"."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Owarimonogatari Episode 04: Sodachi Riddle, Part 2","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Owarimonogatari_Episode_04:_Sodachi_Riddle,_Part_2","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music","#Trivia","#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Sodachi Riddle, Part 2\" (そだちリドル 其の弐, Sodachi Ridoru Sono Ni) is the fourth episode of the Owarimonogatari anime series.

He developed a strong sense of justice because of the influence of his policemen parents, and this personality eventually pushes him to study harder as he notices his slump in academics, especially in math.\nThe Monty Hall problem he encountered in the shoe lockers triggered his curiosity, and this also brought him to meet Sodachi Oikura for the first time. Although Koyomi admitted his lack of care in entering a stranger's house, he eventually considered it to be the reason why he was able to improve in math and become admitted to Naoetsu Private High School. The young Koyomi began studying together with Sodachi, and he slowly explores more things about math in the derelict house, including Euler's identity.\nSodachi agreed to meet with Koyomi under three conditions. First, they can only meet at the second floor of the run-down house. Second, Koyomi must agree to keep their study sessions a secret. And lastly, Koyomi must not ask anything about her and will focus only on questions about math. Sodachi did not wish for any compensation, only for Koyomi to \"stay in love with math\".\nAt the end of summer vacation, Sodachi suddenly did not show up in the usual place, and Koyomi was unable to find out who she is. Fear eventually consumed Koyomi, and he started forgetting about the girl who helped her study about math. Still, the girl's lessons remained with Koyomi, and his grades steadily improved, especially math. It also gave Koyomi a solace that he eventually used during the tumultuous class assembly.\nOugi quickly determines that the girl who taught Koyomi math is Sodachi, and she thinks that Sodachi transferred schools after summer vacation, causing her sudden disappearance. Ougi, however, wonders why Koyomi was unable to meet Sodachi earlier. Koyomi realizes that Sodachi's words about hating people who do not appreciate the people who make them happy pertains directly to him, and Ougi is left with what Sodachi meant when she talked about people who do not know what they are made of. Regardless, Koyomi decides to apologize to Sodachi, even if he has his own problems against Sodachi, especially her uninformed school transfer and the empty envelope she left behind. Ougi, in response, urges him to look deeper into the reason behind it, or otherwise expect Sodachi's wrath once again.\nIn order to \"help\" Koyomi understand Sodachi's circumstances, she serves as a quizmaster as she begins telling clues. Ougi mentions the occupation of Koyomi's parents, as well as her suspicions regarding Sodachi's Monty Hall problem and the uncanny similarity between the ruins of Eikou Cram School and the run-down mansion where he and Sodachi studied together.\nKoyomi gasps as Ougi points out that the house they are currently in, Sodachi Oikura's house wasn't in ruins five years ago, although she also clarifies that the house is already damaged based on Koyomi's past observations. He begins to suspect that Sodachi experienced domestic violence, and Ougi explains that the end of summer vacation five years ago was the breaking point for Sodachi's family, where she transferred schools and probably even changed surnames as a result. According to Ougi, Sodachi inviting Koyomi was her trying to change her bleak life by bringing her family situation to light, but her reluctance to be direct shows her fear over the repercussions of getting Koyomi's parents involved.\nIn the end, Koyomi did nothing that was expected on him, and the empty envelope symbolizes it—that he was the wrong choice, a waste of time.\nOugi decides that it is appropriate to \"close the investigation\" at this point, and leaves Koyomi to say his closing words in the issue. Koyomi voices out that he is starting to feel regretful for being happy as he is right now, but nothing would change the fact that he still loves math.\nThe next day, Koyomi enters a conversation with Tsubasa Hanekawa about Ougi, and Tsubasa is perplexed that Ougi was able to determine the occupation of Koyomi's parents, something that he chooses to withheld to other people. Tsubasa soon thinks that there may be some other thing that allowed Ougi to learn more about Koyomi, and this triggers him to remember something else that he might have forgotten.\nAs Koyomi tries to fathom his own foolishness, he opens the door to his classroom, where he gives up on determining if Sodachi is inside or not."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Trivia":{"link":["https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbakemonogatari.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FOwarimonogatari_Episode_04%3A_Sodachi_Riddle%2C_Part_2%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D6&uselang=en"],"text":"Quotes[]"},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Owarimonogatari Episode 05: Sodachi Lost, Part 1","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Owarimonogatari_Episode_05:_Sodachi_Lost,_Part_1","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Referbacks"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Sodachi Lost, Part 1\" (そだちロスト 其の壱, Sodachi Rosuto Sono Ichi) is the fifth episode of the Owarimonogatari anime series, first broadcast on October 24, 2015.","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsubasa_Hanekawa","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Sodachi_Oikura","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsukihi_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Ougi_Oshino","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Suruga_Kanbaru"],"text":"A downcast Koyomi Araragi talks to Tsubasa Hanekawa about Sodachi Oikura.

Nonetheless, he thanks Tsubasa for laying out the facts to him.\nAlthough flattered by Koyomi's words, Tsubasa points out that \"she does not know anything\", and in that case, she knows little about the girl named Ougi Oshino, and this troubles her. Koyomi returns the favor by dispelling her worries about Ougi, calling her as a mere underclassman that should be under the care of seniors like them.

Koyomi then answers Oikura's accusations of him acting tough and returns it by calling out on her tossing out her own issues.\nOikura soon begins blaming her parents, who divorced \"after Koyomi had failed to help her\". At that time, Sodachi began living on a new home with her mother (who hurt Sodachi occasionally in response to being committed violent acts herself by her father), but her mother also shut herself in one room, closing off the windows and mumbling to herself about her responsibilities as a parent.

Freed of her responsibilities to take care of her mother, Sodachi eventually managed to catch up to her studies, found a legal guardian, and moved to an apartment unit where she continued to live under the support of the government.\nDespite her shaky family background, Sodachi denies that her story is tragic, calling it an experience that others normally experience, and she calms down enough to politely tell Koyomi and Tsubasa to go home. However, Tsubasa is puzzled about the sudden disappearance of Sodachi's mother, since Sodachi told them that the house was locked and the windows were boarded before she arrived.\nOikura is confused about the sudden inquiry about her mother's disappearance, and she soon changes the topic to the time when she stayed in Koyomi's house. Here, she reveals that the happiness and calm of the Araragi family was too much for her to handle, and it compelled her to return to her old home. The experience also changed Sodachi, as it exposed the miserable state of her family. The domestic violence she experienced worsened as she tried to do something about her family, and the despair remained even as she entered middle school and high school.\nSodachi soon starts pleading to Koyomi to be the villain of her life as she is unable to endure antagonizing her parents, and she asks if she deserved such a miserable life. Tsubasa points out that Sodachi is unhappy because she is not making an effort to be happy. Sodachi agrees, saying that she cannot tolerate happiness and would prefer being miserable her entire life.\nKoyomi eventually points out that there is no happiness that crushes others and that she deserves to be happy, even as he willingly accepts every single act of despising Sodachi commits.\nOikura soon abruptly ends their conversation by saying that employees from the local government will come to assess her current situation and does not want to be seen arguing with her classmates.

Afterwards, Ougi heads out to look for a lost child, and warns Koyomi that things may not go as smooth as with Sodachi's case.\nTsubasa soon learns of Sodachi's transfer from Naoetsu Private High School and voices out her disappointment. Then, she talks to Koyomi about filing a leave of absence in preparation for her plan to wander around after graduating and she tells him that she will be gone in a month, during which time she will contact Meme if possible. Koyomi reminds Tsubasa to tell Meme about his niece, and she hesitantly responds.\nInside the classroom, Koyomi receives a text message from Hitagi (who called him \"Koyokoyo\" in the message) telling him that she has to go to the hospital to check her finger that was fractured after punching Sodachi. Hitagi also said that Sodachi came to apologize to her and she forgave her. Koyomi decides to show Hitagi's messages to Tsubasa before she could go abroad, but Hitagi's last message of being \"addicted to his French kisses\" ruined his plan.\nKoyomi also receives a message from Sodachi, pointing him to something under his desk. It was a blank white envelope, the same thing Sodachi left from him when she suddenly disappeared. However, there are pieces of paper inside. Whatever those pieces of paper meant was left to the imagination, but it made Koyomi smiles regardless."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Owarimonogatari Episode 08: Shinobu Mail, Part 1","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Owarimonogatari_Episode_08:_Shinobu_Mail,_Part_1","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Referbacks","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Shinobu Mail, Part 1\" (しのぶメイル 其の壱, Shinobu Meiru Sono Ichi) is the eighth episode of the Owarimonogatari anime series, first broadcast on November 14, 2015.\nAt the start of the new school term, two months before Ougi Oshino becomes a student in Naoetsu Private High School, Koyomi Araragi, who recently lost his link with Shinobu Oshino, encounters a mysterious being who is on a search for Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade and her sword Kokorowatari.","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Ougi_Oshino","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Shinobu_Oshino","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Eikou_Cram_School","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Suruga_Kanbaru","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kiss-shot_Acerola-orion_Heart-under-blade","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kokorowatari","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Yotsugi_Ononoki"],"text":"Two months before Ougi Oshino transferred to Naoetsu Private High School, Koyomi Araragi's link with the vampire Shinobu Oshino was severed, and he experiences being \"human\" for the first time. Koyomi stops attending school and stays in Eikou Cram School for the meantime.\nOne night, Suruga Kanbaru visits him, albeit with her own dose of violence (kneeing him as a form of greeting) and quirkiness (opening topics like not wearing anything under her hoodie) as she confirms about Koyomi's message about wanting her to meet in the cram school building. Koyomi then reveals that he is asked to enlist Suruga in a request whose details are left unknown to him, and he expects Suruga to be persistent in helping him. True enough, Suruga feels compelled to assist Koyomi regardless of the details.\nAs Koyomi and Suruga prepare to head to the real rendezvous point for the person that Suruga has to meet as part of Koyomi's request, a stranger with the appearance of a man wearing a large suit of Japanese armor barges into Eikou Cram School. Suruga immediately attacks the stranger, but finds out that the armor is empty inside. The two soon discuss on what to do with the armor, but the armor once more reassembles itself, prompting Suruga to go on the offensive again. However, Suruga soon finds herself weakening at every punch made at the suit of armor to the point of collapsing after making a few attempts.\nKoyomi immediately identifies that the suit of armor is using a kind of energy drain used by vampires, and he soon looks for a way to escape with Suruga. In response, the suit of armor begins attacking Koyomi and has him held at the neck. Koyomi sees this as a chance for Suruga to run away, but she stubbornly insists in attacking the suit of armor. Shortly, reddish-pink flames engulf the cram school building, and the armor speaks about looking for a \"master\" while using the voice he stole from Koyomi. Koyomi links this with the armor's energy drain ability, allowing it to steal Suruga's strength and tackling skill earlier.\nSoon, the suit of armor reveals that it is looking for Kiss-shot and is looking to retrieve the Kokorowatari, without which he feels incomplete. The armor leaves as the cram school is engulfed with flames, leaving Koyomi and Suruga to find a way out of the burning building. Suruga is already planning to die inside the inferno, but Koyomi refuses to die at that moment. Instead, he gambles on jumping off the window with Suruga.\nThen, as they are about to break through the windows, a blast comes towards them, knocking out Suruga immediately. There, Yotsugi Ononoki appears, claiming that she is the only one who can kill Koyomi."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Owarimonogatari Episode 09: Shinobu Mail, Part 2","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Owarimonogatari_Episode_09:_Shinobu_Mail,_Part_2","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Referbacks","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Shinobu Mail, Part 2\" (しのぶメイル 其の弐, Shinobu Meiru Sono Ni) is the ninth episode of the Owarimonogatari anime series, first broadcast on November 21, 2015.","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Yotsugi_Ononoki","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Eikou_Cram_School","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Mayoi_Hachikuji","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Suruga","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kiss-Shot_Acerola-Orion_Heart-Under-Blade","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kokorowatari","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Izuko_Gaen","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kita-Shirahebi_Shrine","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Namishiro_Park","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Hachikuji","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsubasa_Hanekawa","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Yotsugi_Ononoki"],"text":"After Yotsugi Ononoki's rescue in the smoldering ruins of Eikou Cram School, Koyomi wonders about Yotsugi's reason for being at the place during the fire.

Yotsugi reminds Koyomi of the promise he made to Izuko Gaen, but it was something that Koyomi does not completely forget. However, he is starting to regret making such a deal now that he understood how Suruga cannot refuse to any favor he asks from her. Despite this, Yotsugi urges Koyomi that taking her to Izuko is the best option, especially because there is no guarantee that Suruga will remain safe inside her home, especially because she had involved herself in the case by punching the mysterious being earlier. After gathering his thoughts, Koyomi decides to take Suruga with him to Izuko's whereabouts. Meanwhile, Yotsugi decides to look for the armored samurai alone.\nOn the way to Izuko's place, Koyomi carries Suruga by piggyback, and she decides to relish on the experience as soon as she regains consciousness. (In reality, she is still mentally fatigued, in the same way as her first visit to Kita-Shirahebi Shrine.) Suruga also rejects Koyomi's attempts to apologize to her. Instead, she focuses on their destination, which is Namishiro Park.\nKoyomi, to his shock, soon finds out that he and Suruga are unable to reach Namishiro Park no matter what road they take. He is certain that the Lost Cow is no longer around, so he quickly sees this as the mysterious armored being harassing them. Because of this, he quickly calls Izuko Gaen by phone. However, Izuko did not see Koyomi's \"problem with a snail\" worth giving advice, so she instead leaves Koyomi to sort things out with Suruga. Fortunately, Suruga was able to make alternate routes leading to the nearest place she knows (Hitagi's old residence) and she leads Koyomi to Namishiro Park after three hours of navigating.\nSuruga does not find Izuko in the park. Instead, she found Shinobu near the swings, with scratches in different parts of her body. She later explains that a cat and a doll who stomped Koyomi's face with a bare foot had helped her fight a monkey, and the doll had also informed her of their current problem.

Araragi questions her for sleeping under the swings, but she tells him to try it, under the swings he sees a photo of Gaen telling him to meet her at the shrine. They go to the shrine, and, on the way Koyomi, explains his encounter with the armor. Shinobu dismisses the possibility of her being related to the armor, explaining that there's no way that her first minion had survived, it must be an impostor.\nWhen they reach the shrine they meet Gaen. She sends a message to Ononoki telling her that Koyomi is safe, and comments on how concerned she is for him from the look of his face, she introduces herself as \"Oshino Izuko\", Meme's younger sister. Shinobu falls for the lie, commenting on her similarity to Meme. Kanbaru introduces herself as Araragi's sex slave, Izuko is amused but quickly changes topic to the business at hand. Koyomi explains the situation to her and Izuko quickly states that the armor is indeed the first kin of Kiss-Shot, the first oddity slayer.

He's up to now, still recovering his energy, using Koyomi and Araragi's energy he sucked in the cram school to recover himself. Izuko had wanted Ononoki to deal with him alone, but she hadn't accounted for Koyomi's interference, but she decided to give him a chance to make amends. She asks him for the reason he's been running into so many oddities, and why Kiss-Shot decided to visit his town during spring break, except for the cat, which was a coincidence, she comments on the tiger, telling Araragi that the armored man must have decided to retreat due to his trauma from being burned alive. She tells Koyomi to thank Hanekawa for saving his life for protecting his life unknowingly.\nShe goes back to the topic of explaining the story, she explains that after he was turned into an oddity, the first aberration slayer threw himself into the sun. Supposedly, he turned to ash and was scattered by the wind, leaving Kokorowatari's replica with Kiss-Shot. She explains that he died, but during the last 400 years he continuously recovered and was immediately destroyed by sunlight, without ever becoming more than ash, until his ashes amassed themselves and arrived in town, 15 years ago."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Owarimonogatari Episode 11: Shinobu Mail, Part 4","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Owarimonogatari_Episode_11:_Shinobu_Mail,_Part_4","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Referbacks","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Shinobu Mail, Part 4\" (しのぶメイル 其ノ肆, Shinobu Meiru Sono Yon)is the eleventh episode of the Owarimonogatari anime series, first broadcast on December 5, 2015.","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Izuko_Gaen","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Yotsugi_Ononoki","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsukihi_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsubasa_Hanekawa","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Mayoi_Hachikuji","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Hitagi_Senjougahara","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nadeko_Sengoku","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Shinobu_Oshino","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kanbaru","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kagenui_Yozuru"],"text":"Izuko Gaen explains how fifteen years ago, while in college, she thought of using a resurrection spell on a corpse, thus creating Yotsugi Ononoki.

Then he ponders how he must think of the fifteen years that followed as a span. It started with a shikigami, a phoenix, and a cat, and it continued eleven years ago with a snail ,(after the death of Mayoi Hachikuji), a monkey granting a wish (Kanbaru Suruga), a crab taking the weight off of a girl (Hitagi Senjougahara), and concluded with a snake (Nadeko Sengoku) two months prior.\nHe believes they are all connected to the ashes but Gaen say this is only a distant cause but it had something to do with Shinobu coming to town, Shinobu denies the claim. Araragi thinks he feels jealous that everything is conected to that man. Shinobu insist he is dead and Gaen answers that if her first minion is ressurected that is cause for a celebration, making shinobu angry.\nAt this point Kanbaru intervenes asking how did the cycle of the first minion being ressurected and then reburned by the sun stopped and how he found enough power to appear to Araragi. Gaen says that this town was the first's hometown and 15 year ago this shrine was still maintained,being \"an air spot\", a place where apparitions or bad things, on their way to become apparitions, gathered and where they died. she also explains that in contrast to Meme her job is to deal with apparitions before they happen and this can be done if the air spots can be controlled.This can be achieved while there is a God and that is why a long time ago one was enthrowned here but fifteen years ago reached its limits due to the ahes arriving there. She adds that there have been attemps to fix it but a shrine without a God doesn't have any restrictive abilities and it fell to ruin. Kiss shot and her first minion gather around them apparitions by existing and thus he could feed of the apparitions to gain power and he was driven by revenge.\nKoyomi asked why Yotsugi couldnt handle the job and if it had anything to do with them using the energy gathered in the shrine to travel to the past, but Gaen suggests that all Shinobu did was come to the shrine and that was enough for her first minion to gain power and ressurect, even if the talisman that meme oshino gave to araragi had him starved. So when Yotsugi came to the shrine it was empty. Then Araragi wonders why he didnt call for Kagenui and Gaen explains that she doesnt control her and that she asked for more help cause if he ressurects completly he will be almost unstopable. She wants to kill him before he eats a human.After that she leaves Araragi some money for breakfast and leaves.\nKoyomi asks Shinobu what they should do and she says that everything is going according to the specialist's plan and the first minion will be dead soon. She also reassures Koyomi that he is the one for her and he shouldn't feel envy. Araragi volunteers to go shopping. Kanbaru promises to watch after Shinobu and asks for a light novel with a weird title to which Araragi protests but in the end agrees. She also asks for brassiers and even though he refuses she says she believes he can do it and he can pick one according to his taste.\nKoyomi goes to pick up the books but he is embarrased and decides to buy some magazines containing photos of mature women since lately he is being teased for having a lolita complex because of the time he spends with Shinobu, Ononoki and Hachikuji.

The first rebuffs this saying that he appreciates that she brought him back from near death and that she only needs one minion, which Araragi can't deny as he thought the same. The first minion claims that unlike Araragi he is irreplacable and the chosen one and there is no point in fighting.

He hide behind the bushes and overhears the conversation between the two where Kanbaru tells Shinobu she should see her first minion cause he spend 400 years trying to revive for her, which she denies saying that a minion/master relationship has nothing to do with love or hate and that the only minion she recognizes is Araragi. Kanbaru replies that she can have two minions but if she doesn't want him she can at least tell him. She claims that Shinobu is afraid her feelings will change if she sees him. She continues by telling her that she is betraying herself if she doesn't go and even if she feels that his feelings are a nuisance now that she has Araragi she should just tell him or else she is being bashful and has no right to form any kind of relationship.\nShinobu laughs and asks if she wants these to be her dying words. Kanbaru still refuses to apologize saying that, since she made the first one a thing of the past she can also make the second and the third and any that follows. She explains that Araragi would be fine to die tomorrow if Shinobu was to die too but she wouldn't do the same. Shinobu thinks that it is would be cruel to tell him something like that and asks her if she believes that when something withers it is better to be destroyed. Kanbaru said she does. Then Shinobu points out that if she goes to see him and he wants revenge she will kill him, if he wants forgivness and she gives it to him a specialist will kill him, if she does not love him she will reject him and if she decides she does love him, she will leave Araragi.

She puts a sword that omits electricity and says that the first to deliver a blow with it will be the winner. Araragi asks to be coached by Kanbaru and she gives him advise on how to run to the sword and preserve energy. \nThen Gaen comes and tells him about how Hanekawa is in trouble with the tiger that controls the flames of purgatory and Senjougahara is about to get burned.

She asks what happened next and he says that he joined Kanbaru and went to help with the tiger. After that Kanbaru went to Senjougahara and he went with Hanekawa. Ougi asks if Shinobu ate the armor as well and she point out that another apparition sword can be made from it and in Gaen's place she would have taken it before Shinobu ate it and maybe that is why Episode was there. Araragi does not believe it and Ougi, before leaving, tells him the full name of the first minion Seishirou Shishirui as she thinks he would like to know the name of his romantic rival. \nThen Ononoki appears and tells him he is very talkative around Ougi but Araragi thinks it is fine. Then she asks if he thinks that nobody can be happy if he is with Shinobu. Araragi says yes and OnonokI answers that this sounds like an excuse and he should aim for the happy ending.

Ononoki had unknowngly killed a puppet, and only Izuko and Meme Oshino know that Tadatsuru had been long dead, living through puppets after failing to make himself one.\nA month before Koyomi's death, after, he was contacted by Izuko Gaen through Meme Oshino, and asked to act. Meme told him that he needed someone to act in case Koyomi approached the complete vampirization. He agreed to help out of curiosity.\nSoon, a thread appears from the sky and Mayoi asks Tadatsuru to cut his story short.\nHe quickly explains that Izuko asked him to follow the enemy’s plan and kidnap his sisters and Suruga, he then went back to hell and asked Mayoi for her help. He then acted from hell in order to correct Araragi’s vampirization. Hachikuji pushes Araragi to grab on the thread, that turns out to be a snake's tail.\nBefore ascending Araragi asks Hachikuji to clarify the name of the park where he first met her, wheter it’s read “Namishiro” or “Rouhaku”, Tadatsuru tells him it’s called “Shirohebi”, but it’s sign was misspelled. And it was the former location of the shrine on the mountain. The shrine was transferred from the lake that’s now a park to the mountain and that caused the enshrine god’s decline.\nAraragi begins wondering if he’s worth to be revived and is attacked by Mayoi.

Ougi talks to him about the constellations in the southern hemisphere’s sky. She tells him about the Hydrus, the constellation of the water snake, also know as the Hydra and how it’s presence reminds her of Kiss-Shot and how the Hydra was killed by Hercules by having its heads burned to prevent regeneration.\nShe also mentions that during the fight, the crab from the Cancer constelation side with the Hydra and attacked Hercules. She continues asking him to tell Senjougahara about this story. She adds that the constellation of Serpens, much like the Hydra, is a symbol of immortality but in a different way. Araragi is impressed at her knowledge but Ougi replies that Araragi knows about it already. She goes back to explaining that the Serpens constellation is a symbol of immortality due to being divided in two parts and still existing.\nFurthermore, both sides are helf by the constellation of Ophiuchus, the snake charmer. Ophiuchus decipts Asklepios, the mythical Greek physichian who could revive the dead and brought the rage of the gods because of that. Just like Asklepios, Ougi says that’s why Tadatsuru and Kagenui were cursed for reviving the dead when creating Ononoki. She wonders what kind of punishment will Gaen endure due to reviving Araragi.\nAraragi is reminded of Tadatsuru’s warning and Ougi starts questioning Araragi about what’s the right thing to do in their situation.\nOugi also warns Araragi that all mistakes that accompany justice cause the balance to zero out and the Justice administered by Kagenui and the Fire Sisters is not doing good as much as correcting mistakes, mirroring Araragi’s conversation with Hachikuji.\nShe continues saying that she herself is justice since she seeks to oppose injustice by enforcing the rules. Ougi concludes Araragi’s dream by asking him to do the right thing and to talk with her next time they meet. Araragi asks her about her true identity. She replies that they’ll discuss that at their next meeting, but she tells him that she’s the embodiment of the rules of the universe. Furthermore she asks Araragi not to fall for Gaen’s words and says that she expects him to do the right thing.\nAraragi wakes up besides a sleeping Hitagi Senjougahara. Soon she tells him that they’ll be visiting the museum anex to the planetarium before having lunch and going bowling and then finish with tea and later karaoke. She suggests a penalty for the loser of the game, the loser will have to give absolute obedience to the winner.\nThey continue their date as Senjougahara expected until the bowling game, where Senjougahara loses to the inept Araragi due to her exhaustion. Araragi asks her to walk with their arms linked until they have tea. There Senjougahara suggests that Araragi himself might be the opponent of Gaen’s battle due to Araragi’s impulsivity and lack of foresight when compared to her.\nAt the karaoke, Senjougahara demands the same bet as the bowling game. Senjougahara loses by a slight margin and suggests that Araragi should take her to the car in a princess carry. At the car, Araragi tells her that he wasn’t able to prepare a present for her, but he’ll pay up with interest. Senjougahara dismisses his worries before speeding up in anger. She stops the car and bullies Araragi for not preparing a present for his girlfriend on White Day.\nAraragi apologizes but she agrees to forgive him in trade for complete obedience. Araragi concedes to obey her order for the rest of her life. Senjougahara asks him to call her by her first name from now on. Araragi realizes why she was so competitive and calls her name.\nAt Araragi's house, he meets Ougi continuously ringing his doorbell. She tells Araragi that he should appreciate her for not physically bothering him during his last date. He agrees, but tells her that was just the last date of his high school life. Ougi disagrees with him, since he and Senjougahara might have no future. Araragi confronts her about trying to kill them.\nOugi denies ever trying to harm him and tells him she didn't do it, since she was expecting him not to fall for Gaen's tricks.\nHe retorts that there wasn't any choice since it would involve forsaking Shinobu and Hachikuji. She says she's dissapointed but it's fine since she has nothing to lose. She finishes clearing Araragi's misconception, she's not the Darkness and she tells Araragi that she let him go on his date so that he won't have any regrets and that she has one last thing to do after willingly falling for Gaen's trap.\nShe leaves after asking for Araragi's help against Gaen."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Owarimonogatari Episode 18: Ougi Dark, Part 1","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Owarimonogatari_Episode_18:_Ougi_Dark,_Part_1","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Referbacks","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Ougi Dark, Part 1\" (おうぎダーク 其ノ壹, Ougi Dāku Sono Ichi) is the eighteenth and fifth episode of the second cour of the Owarimonogatari anime series, first broadcasted on August 13, 2017.","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Ougi_Oshino","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Namishiro_Park","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kokorowatari","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Shinobu_Oshino","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Mayoi_Hachikuji","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Izuko_Gaen","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Yotsugi_Ononoki","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/North_Shirahebi_Shrine","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Oddity#The_.22Darkness.22"],"text":"After meeting Ougi Oshino at his house, Koyomi Araragi arrives at Namishiro Park where he meets Gaen, Shinobu and Hachikuji playing baseball with rocks and Kokorowatari, their game is interrupted when Shinobu notices Araragi and excitedly greets him.\nAraragi tries to ascertain Hachikuji's condition, but Gaen informs him that she's still the same ghost he met at the park months ago. Araragi apologizes for not being able to revive her but Hachikuji says she already worked things out with Gaen. Gaen decides to explain everything as soon as Araragi's beautiful slave stops bulliyng Yotsugi Ononoki.\nAfter Araragi interrupts Shinobu's fun, they all sit in a circle in order for Gaen to brief them on her plan. Araragi returns the snake seal as per Gaen's orders and she begins explaining how they must eliminate Oshino Ougi.\nOugi was just a fake name created for convenience, since Ougi's lack of identity is her real identity as an oddity. Araragi asks her how she's sure that Ougi will act tonight, but Gaen assures him that this is the only time she has to act. Gaen then starts explaining the source of the oddities in town.\n400 years ago, Kiss-Shot landed in Japan in a lake temple where the Shirohebi Park is now located. That lake was a sacred lake worshiped by the entire region. Due to Kiss-Shot's violent landing, rain fell on the region that was affected by drought and Kiss-Shot took over as the local god. After she left, the people that were left had no god to worship, and like that, their worshiping survived by merging it with another local religion, one that worshiped a mountain snake, similar to the lake's water snake god.\nThe merging was defectful and bad energy started to accumulate on the temple, despite that, the temple managed to survive until 15 years ago, when Seishirou's ashes arrived in his homeland and absorbed both the bad energy and the local god, driving it to ruin.\nGaen planned to enshrine Shinobu as the new god having her absorb the snake talisman until Nadeko took over as the shrine's god. Araragi says that he intends to do something about Hachikuji and Shinobu's current situation as Hachikuji will soon be swallowed by the Darkness again, to which Gaen replies that her plans include taking care of Hachikuji. She then asks about Koyomi's plans for Shinobu. He replies that he wants the town he lives in to be peaceful, but after accepting that he can't take care of everything, he wants the people around him to be safe.\nGaen replies that while that may be dangerous for her, she can deal with it since Araragi didn't voice any concerns for his own safety. She asks Shinobu about her objective and she answers that she wishes to obey her master's wishes, but if she were to speak for herself, she would like to become a little girl again.\nHaving cleared everyone's objectives, Gaen explains the requirements to achieve Hachikuji, Shinobu and her own wishes, first they must put a new god on the North Shirahebi Shrine, then they must exterminate Oshino Ougi. Araragi interjects about enshrining Shinobu, but Gaen explains that since he brought Hachikuji from hell, she will serve as a better god than Shinobu herself.\nAraragi interjects, but Shinobu explains that Hachikuji having come back from hell is a miracle work of deification, and Gaen explains that it's her only options are to be swallowed by the darkness, go back to hell, or transforming herself into a goddess, which would allow her to exist as long as she manages the town's bad energy.\nArargi continues to be concerned, asking if Hachikuji is compatible with the temple's snake god. Gaen then explains that she's compatible due to the Three-Way deadlock, a game precursor to Rock-paper-scissors in which the snake is beat by the slug, which is close enough in species to Hachikuji's lost snail. If Hachikuji becomes the new goddess, she won't lose control like Nadeko did, since she'll beat the old god. Despite Araragi's concerns, Hachikuji remains positive with her promotion, since she'll be able to keep playing with Araragi and she won't be swallowed by the darkness.\nAraragi then warns Gaen that Oshino Ougi may not be the Darkness. Gaen replies that she knew it already and Ononoki reacts with fake disbelief. Gaen asks Araragi what led him to believing she's the Darkness. He replies that he thought that was the case since she was involved with Nadeko and Tadatsuru so he had a sense that she was like the Darkness preserving the rules.\nGaen explains that Ougi must have felt the same and felt like she had to play the same role and that even if they enshrine Hachikuji, she may be attacked by the fake Darkness that is Ougi, so they must exterminate her. Araragi protests Gaen saying they must exterminate her since that makes her since like an oddity.\nGaen confirms that that's the case.

As for the surname, it's certain that it's fake since Meme has no family, which makes her identity entirely \"unknown\". Gaen's original plan was to exterminate her with the Kokorowatari, which was reforged by her after she predicted an oddity like Ougi would appear.\nShinobu Oshino remains bitter about her theft of the armor, but Gaen explains that she already returned, so there shouldn't be any conflict. Gaen continues explaining that they'll use proper means to exterminate Ougi. Araragi asks her how she predicted Ougi's appearance. She explains that she speaks from experience, after witnessing her sister Tooe Gaen fake Darkness. Gaen confirms and adds that a fake Darkness is more dangerous than a real one, since it wouldn't allow a happy copout ending like Hachikuji's enshrinement, so they must defeat her immediately.\nAraragi decides that he'll reject Ougi's request for help, just like he rejected to kill Kiss-Shot despite her begging, he then asks for Ougi's true identity.\nAt Nadeko's house, Tsukihi Araragi helps shading Nadeko's manga, Tsukihi encourages Nadeko Sengoku to work towards her goal by putting as much effort as she can. Nadeko feels like she's being tricked but accepts the advice. Tsukihi says that, unlike Nadeko, she doesn't have as much drive towards anything, specially now that Karen will move on to high-school and Koyomi is going to college while she'll be separated from both, so she must find her own objectives, just like Nadeko.\nAs soon as Tsukihi leaves Nadeko's house, she's met by Ougi Oshino, who claims to have met her yesterday, a fact which Tsukihi doesn't remember. Ougi then offers to take Tsukihi home on her bike which she accepts. On their way, the two talk about Nadeko's current state, Ougi mentions that she prefers how Nadeko is now, as she thinks that \"girls like that are cuter when they aren't cute\" and she felt sad for Nadeko's cuteness, which she used to bind herself. She continues saying that her cuteness was too precious to throw away,and that's why she needed extreme measures.\nTsukihi asks for clarification, but Ougi claims not to know anything, as \"Araragi is the one that knows\". Ougi follows up asking Tsukihi about her objectives, after Tsukihi says that she has no specific plans, Ougi tells her that she has a future far too large, as she has talent for anything she wants and that if not for her siblings, she would have died during summer break (when Kagenui came after her).\nTsukihi says that's fine since people can't live by themselves. Ougi agrees, saying that monsters like the two of them are the only ones that should live alone. Soon Tsukihi notices that Ougi is going the wrong way.\nOugi feigns being lost until they reach the formerly-burned-down Eikou Cram School. Ougi suggests they should explore the ghostly building. Tsukihi explains what the building used to be and Ougi is dissapointed to discover the building's nature, as she thinks things are more exciting and scary when you don't know their true nature, much like a mystery book. Tsukihi disagrees, as she thinks that the work after finding the truth may be longer, and the solution to the mystery may be wrong.\nWhile ascending the stairs, Ougi laments how, while Tsukihi's true nature may be accepted by those around her, Ougi's might not, as it's unsightly. Ougi stops and says that Tsukihi has no future, she just has a infinite present, and asks her if she thinks that's fine. Tsukihi says she's okay with simply living in the moment, never thinking about the future. When they reach the fourth floor, Ougi dismisses Tsukihi and sends her home with her bike before entering Oshino's old room where she finds Araragi waiting for her.\nOugi questions Araragi's wish to return to his status quo with Shinobu to which replies that he's fine. She then asks what he intends to do with Hachikuji, he tells her of Gaen's plan and Ougi comments on how convenient a solution that is.\nAraragi asks her about her conversation with Tsukihi, and Ougi says that she didn't get to finish her job with her and that a phoenix like her might be more than she can handle and she wonders how Kagenui planned to exterminate her. Araragi says that a oddity can be destroyed by disclosing their true identity, but Ougi doubts even that would sway Tsukihi because of Araragi's love for her despite knowing the truth, which might be why Kagenui gave up.\nOugi concludes their conversation by asking stating that Araragi will disclose her identity and exterminate her right then and there. Araragi replies that he must do it, since he's the only you who can do it, and he wants to do it. Ougi doubts Araragi decided to do it himself, and whether he's doing it for Shinobu and Hachikuji's sake.\nShe continues saying that she's just attempting to plead for her life by appealing to Araragi's sense of justice. She realizes that it's useless to try and rushes Araragi to finish his job.\nAraragi then states Oshino Ougi's identity, she's himself.\nMuch like Tooe Gaen created the Rainy Devil by materializing her overbearing self-control, Araragi materialized his desire to criticize himself. In August he learned of the Darkness, an entity tasked with judging things and correcting them.\nWhen he confronted the Oddity Slayer, he had absorbed some of Kanbaru's energy, including of the Rainy Devil's arm. This energy combined itself with the Shinobu's when he was absorbed by her which created Oshino Ougi, which explains why she's able to use Kiss-Shot's Materialization skill in order to create the fake cram school and Nadeko's hair tie. And Ougi's surname, came not from Meme, but from Shinobu.\nAraragi wanted to be punished for helping the vampire Kiss-Shot. He felt he didn't deserve Hanekawa's feelings for him. He felt like he took advantage of Hitagi after helping her with her problems. He felt inferior to Kanbaru due to her straightforwardness. He felt guilty for not being able to save Nadeko's classmates from the curse. He felt guilty for reconciling with Shinobu.\nAll of that piled up and he felt like he needed someone to correct his mistakes starting with Sodachi. Gaen then speculates that Tsukihi will be Ougi's next target, as he feels guilty for keeping her nature from her."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Riferimenti_culturali:":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Owarimonogatari Episode 20: Ougi Dark, Part 3","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Owarimonogatari_Episode_20:_Ougi_Dark,_Part_3","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Referbacks","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Ougi Dark, Part 3\" (おうぎダーク 其ノ參, Ougi Dāku Sono San) is the twentieth and final episode of the second cour of the Owarimonogatari anime series, first broadcasted on August 13, 2017.","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Ougi_Oshino","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Meme_Oshino","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsubasa_Hanekawa","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsukihi_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Karen_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Mayoi_Hachikuji","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Izuko_Gaen","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Naoetsu_Private_High_School","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Hitagi_Senjougahara","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Shinobu_Oshino"],"text":"Koyomi Araragi confirms Ougi's identity as himself and the Darkness appears to swallow her. Ougi Oshino is surprised at the Darkness quickness, but she remains unfazed having long known that her end was coming. Araragi is disconcerted due to her willingly coming to her death and she replies that there are battles you must lose. But even then, she feels like she made Araragi's adolescence more correct, even if she couldn’t make it better.\nAraragi asks her if she doesn't feel anything for those she wronged but she says that they all deserved it since she was doing right in some cases.\nShe admits being wrong with trying to go after Sodachi, but she says she was right in doing what she did to Nadeko. Araragi asks her whether she thinks she's the right one in confronting him, she admits that since she's losing, she must be in the wrong.\nShe laments the end of her story, but says she's glad to disappear before Araragi's graduation. Araragi feels sympathy for her and tries to save her from the Darkeness and ends up losing an arm to it. Ougi is distraught at Araragi's behaviour and asks him why he saved her, who caused nothing but suffering to him. She tells Araragi that he's wrong in wasting his life trying to delay her innevitable end.\nAraragi says he was just saving himself, just like Hanekawa, Shinobu, Meme, and Senjougahara did. Ougi stops Araragi's bleeding before embracing her end together with Araragi. Araragi says that neither are wrong as Ougi was just doing her purpose just like he's doing his.\nThe two are interrupted by Meme Oshino, who arrives with Tsubasa Hanekawa, who soon collapses in exhaustion.\nOugi is impressed by Hanekawa haivng brought Meme from Antartica. Oshino then berates Araragi for forcing himself on his niece, saying he shouldn't do such a thing to an underclassmate. The Darkness vanishes as Ougi's identity returns to being a fake. Araragi thanks Oshino for helping him, but Oshino tells him that Araragi helped himself. Araragi then collapses on top of Ougi as the fake school vanishes.\nIn the morning, Araragi is woken up by his sisters. He asks Tsukihi why she was growing her hair for, and she says it was for wishing for Araragi passing his exams, so she'll cut it soon. After Karen suggests that he should feed her breakfast and brush her teeth before he leaves for college, Araragi asks her what her right thing to do turned out to be, she answers that it was helping others. Araragi suggests she should try helping herself too.\nOn his way to his graduation ceremony, Araragi meets Mayoi Hachikuji, she refuses to greet him\nas that's unbecoming of a goddess, so he decides to leave, she goes after him and wishes him luck and says that he should visit her shrine any time he wants.\nAraragi is shown to have been taken to Shinobu and Gaen the night before. There, Izuko Gaen says she finds it difficult to believe Shinobu would like to be bound to Araragi's shadow again. Shinobu says that she's tired after spending centuries being hunted, but if Araragi wishes, she'll heal his arm and exile herself on a mountain. Araragi refuses to leave her, saying that mountains don't have Mr. Donuts.\nAraragi repeats his words for her before being turned back into a vampire: \"If you were to die tomorrow, I'd be fine with tomorrow being the last day of my life. But if you decide to live through today, I will also choose to live through today\".\nShinobu now replies with her own words: \"If you were to die tomorrow, I shall live for three days' time and tell of his tale to someone. I shall recite the story of my master with pride to a listening ear\".\nAt Naoetsu Private High School, Araragi meets Hanekawa, she tells him that she has to leave as she \"sold her brains\" for a fighter jet in order to reach Meme. Araragi mentions that if Meme was on the South Pole, Kagenui must be on the North. Ononoki, who stayed with Araragi after Meme and Gaen's suddenly leaving, wanted to go after her, but Kagenui said she's busy fighting polar bears.\nThe two soon meet Hitagi Senjougahara. Hanekawa teases Senjougahara until she calls Koyomi by his first name. She calls both of them by their first names and Hanekawa gladly calls her \"Hitagi-chan\", finally feeling glad to be her friend.\nSenjougahara explains that Kanbaru is waiting for them with a graduation gift, but on their way they meet one of her classmates stumbling down the stairs. Both girls urge Araragi to help her and he gladly goes after her. On his way, he meets Ougi, who comments on how he hasn't changed, but Araragi says that he's changing, but no matter what, he's still himself.\nAs Araragi runs after the aflicted girl, Shinobu Oshino narrates his story from inside his shadow.

The drums, on the other hand, are added from the first verse, with rhythm changes during the bridge sections.

This surprises him, to which he responds in narration:\n\"Seriously? She knew my name and face. If she had a Death Note, I'd be dead...\" (Isin 24).\nIn the Death Note series, a death note is a notebook that causes anyone's name written in it to die, so long as the writer knows their name and face.

Senjougahara replies \"Copper: 40 grams, zinc: 25 grams, nickel: 15 grams, hiding my embarrassment: 5 grams, plus spite: 97 kilograms. These are the ingredients that make up my verbal abuse.\" This is a direct reference to both Fullmetal Alchemist's use of the law of equivalent exchange, as well as a discussion on the composition of a human body from the first arc of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga and repeated in episodes of both the original anime series and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. In Nisemonogatari Episode 3, some doodles of various Fullmetal Alchemist characters, including Roy Mustang, Edward Elric, and Alphonse Elric can be seen in Hitagi's textbook. The implication here is that Hitagi is a fan of the franchise.\n\nMedaka Box[]\nIn Owarimonogatari Episode 09, while Ononoki puts her foot mark on Araragi's face, she says: \"(...)'Jinsei wa saigo ni wa Purasu, Mainasu, Zero ni naru' datte...

She explains how she refuses to acknowledge using the surname Hanekawa — one of many surnames she had throughout her life — and how she fails to grasp her identity.\nShe decides to tell this story to prove that she is not actually a saint as Koyomi Araragi thought of her. Tsubasa Hanekawa is just a mere human... a cat, a tiger, and a human.\nA new day, August 21, begins for Tsubasa Hanekawa. As the roaming vacuum cleaner bumps onto Tsubasa's futon, she wakes up in the hallways of the Hanekawa Residence.\n\nBreakfast is prepared, but each member of the Hanekawa Family is given the responsibility to cook their own food, as the kitchen provides a utensil for each member of the family. After making her own breakfast, changing into her uniform and choosing her reference books to read, she heads out, only to see a familiar kid sporting twintails walking on the street.\nMayoi Hachikuji.\nMayoi greets Tsubasa and admires how Tsubasa has the strength to pursue academics despite the fact that it is summer break. She then tells Tsubasa that she visited the Araragi Residence to pick up her bulky backpack she left after Koyomi \"dragged her home\" the day before, but wasn't able to find his bicycle there, so she assumed that Koyomi left early. However, Tsubasa thinks that Koyomi actually didn't come back home the night before, explaining his absence.\nTsubasa decides to tell Mayoi that she will inform Koyomi about her the next time they meet, to which Mayoi obliges, although Tsubasa had to stop Mayoi from spoiling certain plot points.\n\nSoon, Tsubasa walks into a crossroad, and she quickly froze in fear as she sees a tiger — no, an oddity in the form of a white tiger with orange stripes — approaching her. Then, the tiger speaks to her, referring to \"white lies of ignorance, before walking past her, showing his enormous size compared to Tsubasa's body.\nThen, in an instant, the tiger vanishes.\n\nAt Naoetsu Private High School grounds, Tsubasa tells Hitagi of the sight she witnessed a while ago. Although Hitagi doesn't seem interested in listening to Tsubasa's story in detail, Hitagi quickly reacts to Tsubasa's mention of seeing a tiger, not a cat, by taking her elsewhere. There, she tells Tsubasa that someone like Koyomi should be the one more appropriate in this situation that concerns an oddity roaming around town. However, Tsubasa learned from Mayoi earlier that Koyomi is somewhere else, and she never considered contacting him through phone, something that Hitagi is rather cautious about.\nHitagi then wonders if Tsubasa had called for Koyomi's help before. The two then reveal that they haven't yet, or rather Koyomi was able to help them — and anyone else, for that matter — before they could help him out. Hitagi then suspects that Tsubasa may in fact be exploiting Koyomi's tendency to \"help before needing help himself\". She then tells Tsubasa that she should be more honest and speak out if ever she needs help, thinking that Koyomi would like to hear from her.\nSoon, Hitagi heads out, reminding Tsubasa that trying to solve problems by herself is never a good idea and it is okay for Tsubasa to contact her if ever she needs help.\nMinutes later, as Hitagi and Tsubasa head to their classroom, Hitagi is surprised to find that there is a fire at a distance.\nTsubasa quickly recognizes the fire as the Hanekawa Residence going up in flames.\n\nTsubasa was completely stunned the moment she steps into the rubble which was the Hanekawa Residence. And that day was the first time the members of the Hanekawa Family had a conversation, particularly about where to stay while the family looks for a new place to live for the meantime. Tsubasa chose to sleep over at a friend's place, and with her parents' immediate consent, she heads to the remnants of the Eikou Cram School building.\nHanekawa shows her resourcefulness as she uses the amenities of the old building, some convenience store food, as well as the school and nearby establishments to adapt to the absence of a decent home, even using several wood panels to simulate the ones used at a house.\nDespite using pieces of cardboard and newspaper pages as a futon and blanket, Tsubasa thought that she slept much more soundly in the cram school's ruins than in her own home.\n\nThen, her sleep was interrupted when Hitagi, drenched with tears, rushes to her, utterly devastated about her well-being. After being slapped by Hitagi in the face a few times, Tsubasa apologizes (or rather, was forced to).\nHitagi explains that she has been looking for Tsubasa throughout ever since losing contact of her that night; Tsubasa tells Hitagi that she turned her phone off to conserve its power. Hitagi then confesses to Tsubasa that she met her parents, and they were the ones who informed her about Tsubasa's decision to sleep over at a friend's place; in that encounter, Hitagi thinks that Tsubasa shoudn't have the right to call them \"Mother\" and \"Father\".\nAfterwards, Hitagi spent the rest of the night thinking of where Tsubasa slept over after hearing nothing about Tsubasa's sleepover from her friends. Hitagi admits that she considered sleeping at Eikou Cram School to be a desperate, last resort, so she is rather upset that she found Tsubasa there. On the other hand, Tsubasa shows her concern for Hitagi after finding out that she actually spent the whole night looking for her, but she thanks Hitagi for the concern.\nThen, as daybreak comes, Hitagi invites, no, blackmails, Tsubasa to come to her place.\n\nHitagi welcomes Tsubasa to her house like a suitor greeting a young maiden into his mansion, although all that remains of the Senjougahara's riches is a dilapidated apartment unit made up of newspaper pages and wooden planks. Regardless, Tsubasa seems relieved to have stayed over.\nAs Tsubasa imagines what her house was while it was consumed by flames, she wonders what \"her home\" is.\nHitagi soon strips off her top, telling Hanekawa that she is a bit sleepy due to the fatigue of going back to track and ending up with a sore back and legs. That, and for Tsubasa to take care of her severe case of bed head. She also tells Tsubasa to not attend school for a day as she just had a bad experience with a house fire, but Tsubasa seems to hesitate. It is only when Hitagi challenges Tsubasa to fight her to regain her right to go to school that Tsubasa decides to follow Hitagi's advice.\nMinutes later, Hitagi calls the school faking a case of off-season influenza. Although Tsubasa is rather worried that the school might see through her lie, Hitagi doesn't show any worry.\n\nSoon, Hitagi tells Tsubasa that she will take a shower, and invites Tsubasa to join her. Despite Tsubasa's refusals, Hitagi shows her determination to take a glimpse at Tsubasa's body, and even pleads while kneeling at her. Tsubasa thinks that distancing from someone who was deeply worried about her is not a good gesture, so she decides to accept her offer.\nThen, both Tsubasa and Hitagi receive a message from Koyomi, telling the two that he cannot go back for a while. Hitagi quickly suspects that Koyomi is facing something that may be as bad as what happened during spring break, but admires Koyomi's decision to inform his friends about it. Unfortunately, Hitagi wasn't able to reach Koyomi by phone. She then decides to tease Koyomi about having been able to take a shower with Tsubasa when he comes back.\nHitagi then reminds Tsubasa that with Koyomi's absence, they would have to deal with the tiger oddity by themselves. Hitagi suspects that the tiger was responsible for the fire in the Hanekawa Residence, but neither was sure that it has anything to do with the fire.\nHitagi then quickly undresses herself as she tells Tsubasa to prepare for the shower. Tsubasa quickly gets out of her uniform when Hitagi asks Tsubasa if she still loves Koyomi.\nShe quickly answered, \"Yup, I still love him.\""},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Second Season Episode 02: Tsubasa Tiger, Part 2","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Season_Episode_02:_Tsubasa_Tiger,_Part_2","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Referbacks"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Tsubasa Tiger, Part 2\" (つばさタイガー　其の弐, Tsubasa Taiga, Sono Ni) is the second episode of the Monogatari Series Second Season anime series.

She reveals that she knew Koyomi even before spring break, although she admits that she doesn't know everything about him. Tsubasa then explains Koyomi's habit of skipping class, which earned him a bad reputation in Naoetsu Private High School, to the point that his sisters' school life pales in comparison to his.\nAccording to Tsubasa, Koyomi's school life during middle school and high school are not that different — his motivations did change, however, and there was a point where Tsubasa even pointed out that Koyomi is lucky to be alive to enter high school. That ultimately changed when he stepped into 10th grade.\nDespite Koyomi's rather tumultuous past, Tsubasa accepts Koyomi for what he is, and that she has been in love with that kind of person since \"who-knows-when\".\nAs for how that love developed... Tsubasa decides to leave that to another time.\n\nTsubasa wakes up inside Hitagi's place for the first time and manages to catch a glimpse of Hitagi's sleeping face. Moments later, Hitagi opens her eyes and asks Tsubasa for the time. As it turns out, the two girls slept throughout the entire morning and woke up at 1:30 in the afternoon.\n\nThe previous night, Hitagi pushes through her offer of taking a shower with Tsubasa. As the two enjoy the warm water on their skin, Tsubasa considers this moment, as well as her race across town to look for her, as something rather uncharacteristic of Hitagi, who is known for \"building walls around herself\". Tsubasa thinks that Hitagi has changed a lot after facing the things that she has experienced over the course of spring and summer, compared to her, who remained static in spite of facing roughly the same trials.\nThat was the reason why Tsubasa envied Hitagi so much.\nAfter half an hour of goofing around, the two girls head back for a change of clothes.\n\nTsubasa and Hitagi change into a pair of pajamas and Hitagi takes some time to help Tsubasa dry out her hair using an electric dryer. Afterwards, Hitagi brings out an extra futon, the one her father often uses, for Tsubasa to use, although Hitagi is rather hesitant to lend it to Tsubasa. Hitagi then decides to put her father's futon back and asks Tsubasa to sleep with her in one futon, even pleading for her to agree. Although having second thoughts about it, Tsubasa decides to go with Hitagi's request. Hitagi then lends her pillow to Tsubasa while she decides to sleep using her father's pillow — a decision Hitagi made because she has a weakness for her father and she wanted to be as close to Tsubasa as possible.\nAs the lights go out, Tsubasa says \"good night\" to Hitagi for the first time.\n\nBack to the present, after an unusually deep sleep the night before, Hitagi decides to prepare lunch for the two of them. After a short period of prep time, Hitagi makes stir-fry vegetables, some soup and a cup of rice for the two of them. While eating, Hitagi talks about how the dish she prepared wasn't enjoyed that much by Koyomi. Tsubasa disagrees, and pointed out that tastebuds differ from person to person. Hitagi then responds by remarking that she and Tsubasa have the same tastes when it comes to food and men, the latter causing Tsubasa to spit out her food in surprise.\nTsubasa thinks that Hitagi has been too frank with her lately. Hitagi, however, sees this as a perfect chance to start a good conversation. Tsubasa, however, warns Hitagi that one wrong move may cause the gap between them to widen even further. She then decides to ask something else related to Koyomi, particularly the parts of the body that they like the most about him. Hitagi declines, thinking that it would only boost Koyomi's ego if ever he finds out about it, so she decides to talk about that things that they detest about Koyomi, to which Tsubasa quickly agrees on.\nMinutes later, Hitagi discusses about Tsubasa's plans for the future, especially how Tsubasa will be able to stay for longer with Hitagi's father returning home the day after. Tsubasa tells Hitagi that fire insurance will cover the costs for rebuilding the Hanekawa Residence and they would need to rent for at least a week while the house is not yet done. With that, Hitagi decides to extend Tsubasa's stay in the Senjougahara Residence.\n\nLater that night, Black Hanekawa manifests herself while Tsubasa is asleep, a habit that was the cause of the missing chapters 8 and 13 earlier. After admiring her new look in the mirror, Black Hanekawa decides to go out and appease the stress her \"mistress\" Tsubasa Hanekawa had received during the fire that destroyed her home, something that she has been doing for some time now.\nHowever, she decides to go on a detour, meeting another oddity roaming the town.\nAs Black Hanekawa appears in front of the tiger-shaped oddity, the latter remarks that she looks like a sawarineko but is not exactly one, particularly because this particular sawarineko has a more substantial presence than the usual. Nonetheless, the tiger-shaped oddity shows his indifference towards the oddity in front of him, but he does warn her about trying to get in his way. Black Hanekawa responds by another warning, telling the tiger-shaped oddity that she bears the same indifference to him as him towards her, but will be willing to kill him if she harms her mistress.\nThe tiger-shaped oddity seems unmoved by Black Hanekawa's threat and is instead interested that the sawarineko chose to side with the human he met in a previous encounter.\nHowever, what he thinks is important at that moment was that Tsubasa Hanekawa had seen him.\nTrue enough, Black Hanekawa was unable to escape the tiger-shaped oddity even after leaping back several hundred meters into a forested area. There, the tiger-shaped oddity declares that he has already started moving.\n\nBlack Hanekawa returns just before the sun sets, and she was startled by Hitagi, who tells her to wipe her feet before entering. Hitagi then reveals that she is rather familiar with Tsubasa Hanekawa's other persona and offers a handshake. Black Hanekawa refused the gesture, pointing out that her passive ability can drain a person's life force, but Hitagi assures her that a handshake wouldn't kill her that easily.\nBlack Hanekawa decides to go with Hitagi's request, and Hitagi formally greets Black Hanekawa for the first time.\n\nTsubasa wakes up at 6:00 AM, and Hitagi is already awake at this time, telling Tsubasa that she did an early morning jog as part of her routine to maintain her figure. Tsubasa easily notices the weariness in Hitagi's eyes as she changes to a running attire and declines the offer to take a jog with her. Instead, Tsubasa decides to prepare breakfast, composed of sliced baguettes, a cup of milk, fresh salad, and bacon and eggs.\nAlthough she finished Tsubasa's breakfast quite easily, Hitagi notices that Tsubasa's breakfast had some problems: there is no dressing in the salad she prepared, the eggs do not have a pinch of salt or some soy sauce on it, and the bread has nothing to make it other than plain.\nAfter some questions about Tsubasa's eating preferences, Hitagi realizes that Tsubasa is the type of person who refuses to add any seasoning to the dishes she eat or prepare...\n...and a person who refuses to fix something even if it is undesirable.\n\nAs Hitagi washes the dishes, she takes back what she said about her and Tsubasa sharing the same tastes. She explains that Tsubasa is the extreme opposite of a picky eater — a person who eats any food that is edible and nutritious or at least filling — and Hitagi thinks that such kind of living is wrong. Hitagi points out that loving something and hating something are things that are just as important, but adds that Tsubasa is a person who accepts anything and everything that comes her way.\nThen, without looking away from Tsubasa's eyes, Hitagi asks Tsubasa if she really does love Koyomi."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Second Season Episode 03: Tsubasa Tiger, Part 3","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Season_Episode_03:_Tsubasa_Tiger,_Part_3","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References","#Referbacks"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Tsubasa Tiger, Part 3\" (つばさタイガー 其の参, Tsubasa Taiga, Sono San) is the third episode of the Monogatari Series Second Season anime series.

She points out that showing one's virtue to the public would make a person vulnerable to exploitation, and Hitagi tells Tsubasa that Koyomi would even consider pretending to be a bad person if the need arises, unlike her who do not understand such a concept, or rather, underestimate such a concept.\nTo Hitagi, Tsubasa is simply \"too pure a white\", attaching oneself too closely on virtue and sound logic at the cost of exposing oneself to explotation and loneliness.\nIf Tsubasa stays this way, she will \"fail in the wild\", Hitagi adds.\nHitagi's words resounded on Tsubasa's mind as Naoetsu Private High School continues on its next school term. However, her mind is quickly distracted by the textbook Hitagi lent to her, which had scribbles from a certain anime series.\nIn another day, Tsubasa meets Suruga Kanbaru, who has been looking for Hitagi. Tsubasa ends up covering up for Hitagi's absence, and at that moment describes her as \"very polite, but very inconsiderate\". Soon, Suruga decides to ask a favor to Tsubasa as she shows her phone with Koyomi's message which reads: \"Come to the 2nd floor classroom tonight alone. I need to ask you something.\" Suruga has no idea what the message meant, so she asks Tsubasa about it.\nTsubasa thinks that there is nothing else hidden between the lines aside from \"meeting someone in a certain place at a certain time\" and points out that Koyomi may have been referring to the Eikou Cram School Ruins instead. Suruga thinks that he is asking her for a date, and not even Tsubasa's reasoning could get to her. Relieved that Tsubasa seems to be fine, she sprints away, leaving behind Tsubasa, who doubts that she actually knew everything about the Hanekawa Residence fire incident.\nIn addition to that, Tsubasa suspects that there must be a specific reason why Koyomi chose to send Suruga a message, and it was the reason why she found Suruga's conversation with her quite unreasonable.\n\nUpon heading back home, Tsubasa is welcomed by Hitagi, who noticed that she went home later than usual. As Tsubasa explains her short shopping trip to restock the food she and Hitagi consumed during the past days, she is startled by the presence of none other than Hitagi's father. After a short exchange of greetings, Tsubasa goes to accompany Hitagi while the latter's father prepares from tea.\nMeanwhile, Tsubasa tells about Suruga's message from Koyomi, to which Hitagi responds by threatening to disembowel Suruga next time she meets her. Fortunately, Tsubasa managed to remind her of her decision to change her personality. Tsubasa thinks that Koyomi must have a reason to send that message to Suruga alone, and she assumes that the left arm of the Rainy Devil is one of those reasons.\nHitagi then asks Tsubasa if she would go, considering that she knew about this imminent meeting with Koyomi. However, Tsubasa decides not to, as she thinks that she would only get in the way. Hitagi then goes along with Tsubasa's decision as well, a bit confident that Koyomi is not hiding something from her unlike the time with the Rainy Devil. To add, Hitagi reminds Tsubasa that Koyomi and Suruga are not the only ones who are still attached with an oddity, one way or the other.\nSoon, Hitagi stands up to receive more visitors, and upon seeing the Fire Sisters at the doorstep, Tsubasa knew that something is going on without her knowledge. Tsubasa thinks that Hitagi coerced the Fire Sisters into taking her into the Araragi Residence for the meantime and, just as planned, Tsubasa ends up being warmly welcomed into Koyomi's home, to which she quickly accepts for the meantime.\nAlthough a bit anxious about finding out that Koyomi's — and by extension, the Fire Sisters' — parents are police officers, Tsubasa decides to trust the Fire Sisters in their word, albeit not wholly optimistic about it. And, as she slowly undresses herself for a bath, she can't help but feel a bit guilty for exploiting the Fire Sisters' sense of justice, thanks to Hitagi's \"secret plan\". Tsubasa felt like Hitagi handed the role of \"villain\" to her hands, and that she is being forced to ask for help, not something that she usually does nor something in the line of Meme Oshino's ideology.\nTsubasa recalls the harsh words she received from Hitagi before heading to the bathtub, where the Fire Sisters have already started taking a bath.\nIn the bathtub, Tsubasa sits crouched as she, Tsukihi and Karen enjoy themselves in the bath. Karen is pleased to know that Tsubasa was able to talk to them at their level despite being much smarter than them. Tsukihi agrees, although she thinks that Tsubasa's kindness is something found in even the more unreachable persons, as long as they have a truly genuine character.\nAfter the bath, Tsubasa is led to Koyomi's bedroom, where she is given Koyomi's pajamas to wear, much to Tsubasa's shock. Meanwhile, the Fire Sisters head off to their room, oblivious to the fact that they gave a girl a boy's pajamas.\nFor that reason, as well as having to sleep using Koyomi's bed, pillow and blanket, Tsubasa ends up sleepless until about midnight. Tsubasa admits that she cannot blame Koyomi this time, since she has a weakness for Koyomi after all. Minutes later, as Tsubasa finally goes to sleep, Black Hanekawa emerges.\nUpon realizing that she is in Koyomi's bedroom, Black Hanekawa suspects that Tsubasa still has some stress inside her, but she thinks that there is another source of that stress aside from the fire that took out the Hanekawa Residence. Disregarding all that, Black Hanekawa is rather relieved that she is able to manifest freely at this time, unlike in two previous occasions, one of which required the powers of a certain short vampire to suppress her.\nTo Black Hanekawa's shock, that \"short vampire\", who now goes by the name of Shinobu Oshino, appears from the shadows in the unlit bedroom, seemingly uninterested to determine the reason for Black Hanekawa's unexpected visit to the Araragi Residence. Black Hanekawa then asks about how she is now far away from Koyomi, and Shinobu points out that her link with her master, Koyomi Araragi, has been severed for some reason.\nBlack Hanekawa then decides to tell Shinobu that Koyomi should have been in the cram school ruins three hours ago, meeting the \"girl with the monkey\". Shinobu is rather surprised in this piece of information, and soon praises both Koyomi for thinking things out and Black Hanekawa for giving out that information. In fact, Shinobu is pleased enough to avoid targetting Black Hanekawa as her dinner for that night, much to Black Hanekawa's relief.\nHowever, Shinobu warns Black Hanekawa that the suppressive measure she performed at an earlier time is supposed to be just makeshift, and is something that may no longer work the next time around. On the other hand, Black Hanekawa is already relieved to be given this scope of freedom, but she decides to become someone who is different from Tsubasa Hanekawa to serve as a counterbalance of sorts. Shinobu points out that Koyomi also has an issue with open and hidden facets of character, but Tsubasa suffers from a tendency to wander aimlessly at times.\n\nShinobu then decides to tell a story about Napoleon, who was rumored to sleep three times and spent six hours taking a bath; in this story, she explains that two entirely different things may in fact be related. In the case of Tsubasa Hanekawa and her severed persona, Shinobu remarks that she does not sense any definitive difference between her two personalities.\nAlthough a bit relieved by Shinobu's observation, Black Hanekawa still does not see this as a reason to be suppressed at this time. Shinobu agrees, suggesting that a natural disappearance of an oddity is best, both in a specialist and an oddity's viewpoint.\nBlack Hanekawa then decides to ask a question to Shinobu before the vampire plans to head to the Eikou Cram School Ruins to assist her master, whom she thinks will die if she doesn't make it in time. Black Hanekawa asks about the tiger oddity that has been roaming around town lately, and although Shinobu has a wealth of information about tiger-shaped oddities, she wasn't able to pinpoint the exact oddity that Tsubasa encountered.\nShinobu prepares to leave, but Black Hanekawa decides to lend a helping hand.\nBy absorbing some of Shinobu's energy, Black Hanekawa with Shinobu in her arms heads straight to Eikou Cram School in one powerful leap.\n\nAnd upon arriving, they stumble upon the old building, burnt completely to ashes."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Second Season Episode 04: Tsubasa Tiger, Part 4","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Season_Episode_04:_Tsubasa_Tiger,_Part_4","toc":["#Synopsis",{"#Characters":["#New_Characters"]},"#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Referbacks","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Tsubasa Tiger, Part 4\" (つばさタイガー 其の肆, Tsubasa Taiga, Sono Shi) is the fourth episode of the Monogatari Series Second Season anime series. It was first broadcast on July 28, 2013.\nMore painful truths are unveiled before Tsubasa Hanekawa through different people... the mother of her most beloved, someone who had almost taken her life, and someone who claims to know everything. Tsubasa slowly comes into acceptance of what she is and what her other side is, and by the end of the day, she finally makes a decision that would become a turning point in her life.","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Mizudori","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Rousokuzawa"],"text":"Tsubasa wakes up at morning, and she wonders if she went outside after smelling dirt in her clothes and noticing that her fingernails are all dirty. Initially, she suspected that she was sleepwalking, but upon seeing a strand of silver hair in her bed, Tsubasa concludes that she is once more transforming into a sawarineko... Black Hanekawa.\nFortunately for Tsubasa, she doesn't seem to have the same \"symptoms\" unlike Black Hanekawa's two previous manifestations, but wonders if this is due to her getting used to the transformation. That said, Tsubasa is rather worried that Black Hanekawa is running around again, particularly after the fire that took out her home.\nSoon, Tsubasa is called by Tsukihi, who is there to invite her to join the breakfast table, a custom of the Araragi family. Happy about this gesture, she decides to change into the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School and heads downstairs.\n\nAfter the hearty breakfast, Tsubasa decides to take her leave. However, the mother figure of the Araragi family, still dressed in office attire, calls her back and shortly lectures her about taking the Hanekawa lightly, reminding Tsubasa that she cannot be admitted to the Araragi residence despite her current family situation.\nThe words from Koyomi's mother resound in her mind, particularly \"averting one's eyes is not running away\". Then, something else that she wanted to look away from suddenly appears in front of her while making her way to school. The man who almost killed her in a past encounter.\nAlthough shocked about this man's presence in town, Tsubasa courteously asks Episode about his reasons for coming back. In response, Episode explains that he deems courtesy unneeded, particularly because he is a six-year-old half-vampire despite looking like a young adult. Episode then decides to return to Tsubasa's question, and tells Tsubasa that he was \"called in\" on this town by a certain someone, and he cannot turn down the offer despite not knowing what the case is about due to the client's connections. Unfortunately, Episode doesn't seem interested in hunting tigers due to his specialty in vampires, either.\n\nSoon, Episode's client appears from an elevated platformm dressed in what looks like a hip-hop attire and a smartphone, introducing herself as Meme's senior, Izuko Gaen. Episode denies that he has been hitting on Tsubasa and is soon asked by Izuko to come along, although she reveals that she wished for either Meme or Deishuu Kaiki to show up. As Episode wonders what Izuko is actually talking about, Izuko decides to bid farewell to Tsubasa, telling her that she cannot help in her \"tiger problem\".\nTsubasa is rather surprised that she knows about the tiger oddity running loose.\nIzuko's response: \"There's nothing I don't know. I know everything.\"\nIzuko then adds that she expects Tsubasa to encounter the tiger, which she named \"Kako\" (苛虎, lit., \"tormenting tiger\"), anytime soon, and that there is no one with the power to subdue this beast, even \"the boy she likes the most\"... Koyomi Araragi. Izuko then proceeds to lecture about wisdom and ignorance, that it is not considered wisdom if a person knows of his ignorance, and both acknowledges and teases Tsubasa about the realization that she, like most people, does not know everything.\n\nTsubasa decides to take a detour while on her way back to the Araragi Residence after school and decides to investigate more about the fire that destroyed the ruins of Eikou Cram School. She thinks that neither Koyomi nor Suruga has anything to do with the fire; although she has no certainty in that statement, she is sure that Black Hanekawa relayed that information to her.\nAs she passes by the local library, Tsubasa decides to visit the library, in hopes of learning about this new oddity. However, after scouring the library about the occult, she was unable to find anything about an oddity by the name of \"Kako\". Then, upon looking at the New Releases section of the library, Tsubasa thought about the possibility of \"Kako\" as a new oddity.\nAt Namishiro Park, Tsubasa does some more research, and finds out that there is a saying which states, \"Bad politics are worse than a tiger\" (苛政は虎よりも猛し, Kasei wa tora yori mo takeshi). She then discusses Hitagi about a possible link between the oddity and the saying, although she thinks that if \"Kako\" is worse then bad politics, then this tiger actually surpasses tigers. Hitagi, who is in the middle of making paper cranes, suspects that Tsubasa is being led to by Izuko's words. Then, Hitagi reveals that this certain Miss Gaen may actually be related to Suruga Kanbaru, as Suruga's maiden name is Gaen and Suruga herself admits that she used the name Suruga Gaen once. Hitagi thinks that the relation is too strong to be mere coincidence.\nThen, Hitagi pitches in a hypothesis. She thinks that \"Kako\" may in fact be associated with the word \"past\" (過去, kako). However, Hitagi points out that \"Kako\" may also be rendered as 火虎 (lit., \"inflaming tiger\"). Hitagi points out that the name holds a lot of troublesome meanings and is a bit worried, particularly because the places which burned down the day after Tsubasa encountered the tiger-shaped oddity were the places where Tsubasa stayed over.\nThis means, the Senjougahara Residence and the Araragi Residence are most likely to be turned to ashes soon.\n\nWith the determination to end this once and for all, Tsubasa returns to the Araragi Residence, where Karen greets her return. It turns out that Karen hasn't heard about Koyomi lately, and Karen promises to punish him when he comes back. Tsubasa, on the other hand, thinks that Koyomi has a very valid reason for staying out late. Karen then decides to invite Tsubasa over for a game of card stacking, one that Tsubasa is unable to turn down.\nSoon, Tsubasa asks the Fire Sisters about what they associate with the word flame. Karen connects the word \"flame\" with the words \"passion\" and \"justice\", while Tsukihi associates it with \"love\", and the real reason behind the naming of the Fire Sisters is due to the character for \"fire\" in their names (火憐 and 月火).\nTsukihi then reveals that the Fire Sisters also give out romantic advice aside from being the paragons of justice, and among their clients is Koyomi himself, however, they already forgot about the girl which made Koyomi go head over heels. This is mentioned as being back in \"May\", and leads Tsubasa to ask if the advice in May was about Senjougahara.\nThe Fire Sisters then proceed to argue about their respective views on romance, and they soon mention their boyfriends, Mizudori (瑞鳥, lit., \"auspicious bird\") and Rousokuzawa (蝋燭澤, lit., \"candle swamp\"). Tsubasa is rather surprised to know that they have boyfriends, and the two point out that they are like Koyomi, and they currently don't exist inside his head, much to Tsubasa's chagrin. Karen then admits that she wants Koyomi to acknowledge them, but he refuses to meet either of them. On the other hand, the two girls are annoyed that Koyomi already has Hitagi introduced to them.\nAt that moment, Tsubasa realizes that she forgot another word associated with \"fire\": \"envy\".\nIn Koyomi's point of view, his decision to not meet his sisters' boyfriends is him averting his eyes from the truth, and Tsubasa can somewhat relate to his situation. In a sense, they are alike.\nTsubasa's quivering hands break down the card pyramid upon realizing the truth.\n\nAfter that game, Tsubasa slumps on Koyomi's bed, remembering the events that had happened... talking casually with someone who almost killed her in the past.\nThen, she decides to spread her scent across Koyomi's bed, in an attempt to \"mark\" Koyomi's territory, in an attempt that he'd notice her scent even though she could never see him again. Afterwards, she changes to a pair of denim pants, a white shirt and a blue collared top and sends a picture of her to someone. Then, as she slowly accepts the fact that there's someone carrying all of her burdens, she writes a letter to her other side...\n...to Black Hanekawa."},"#New_Characters":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Second Season Episode 05: Tsubasa Tiger, Part 5","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Season_Episode_05:_Tsubasa_Tiger,_Part_5","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Referbacks","#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Tsubasa Tiger, Part 5\" (つばさタイガー 其の伍, Tsubasa Taiga, Sono Go) is the fifth episode of the Monogatari Series Second Season anime series and the last episode of the Tsubasa Tiger story.

Afterwards, he had to take care of the very vampire that bit him, who lost much of its powers and has regressed to the form of a young girl.\nAfter what seemed like his last taste of the supernatural, Koyomi stumbles upon another supernatural entity, an oddity called a sawarineko, which charmed his friend (and \"love interest\") Tsubasa Hanekawa during a time when she was in a stressful situation with her stepparents. Meme Oshino, a supernatural expert who had helped him before, tells Koyomi of Tsubasa's current situation, something that Koyomi doubted at first. It was only when he was brutally attacked by Tsubasa herself, in the form of the sawarineko. Koyomi made a full recovery after sleeping for ten whole days.\nUpon waking up in the ruins of Eikou Cram School, Meme warns Koyomi about confronting the sawarineko, despite making it out barely alive due to his vampire blood. Meme then decides to deal with the sawarineko by himself. During this time, Koyomi decides to know more about Tsubasa, only to be frightened by what he saw (or didn't see) inside the Hanekawa Residence.\nMeme soon shows up defeated by Tsubasa's other persona, which he later calls Black Hanekawa, and gives up on intervening. To him, the only way to deal with an oddity that was able to use its host's knowledge is to let its host deal with the oddity.\n\nBlack Hanekawa and Koyomi encounter once more, but this time, the oddity clarifies things with Koyomi. First, her actions are motivated by what Tsubasa actually wants. Second, during their moment of contact, Tsubasa did not show any pity to the cat she just buried.

After pleading for many days to Shinobu, he acquires Shinobu's oddity-killer, the Kokorowatari, and uses it in an attempt to subdue the sawarineko while it is inside Tsubasa. During their confrontation in the ruins of Eikou Cram School, Koyomi finally discovers that Tsubasa and the sawarineko actually share the body unlike a parasite infecting a host; in fact, Tsubasa may have been acting hand in hand with the sawarineko to appease her stress instead of facing her problems head-on.\nTsubasa, with her cover blown, decides to use Koyomi to take away her stress by killing him on the spot.

Yotsugi reassures Koyomi that she is alone and was \"dispatched\" to do something, but she also warns Koyomi to stop reminding him of her catchphrase \"I said, with a posed look\". After momentarily asking about Shinobu Oshino, they head to a nearby ice cream shop, where Koyomi talks about Mayoi and his need to return her backpack. Yotsugi's interest about seeing a ghost forget something shifts the topic to Yotsugi's nature as an oddity, and she quickly reveals that she is a tsukumogami, an oddity based on a tool that had a grudge on its owner after being used short of 100 years. She then adds that she died once and was \"reincarnated\", compared to Koyomi who did not die as an immortal vampire and Mayoi who died once and became a wandering ghost.\nAs they move to a nearby park, Yotsugi wonders about why she, Koyomi and Mayoi have continued living on and whether there is a reason for it. Koyomi is sure that the question has crossed his mind, but he doesn't know if he or Mayoi can answer it. Regardless, Yotsugi wanted Koyomi to ask Mayoi about it so that she could know if Mayoi was truly happy to be a ghost.\nThat night, Koyomi returned home with Mayoi's backpack still with him. Ononoki's questions still linger on his mind, but he is certain that Mayoi is not the kind of person to answer those questions.

To makes things worse, though, Shinobu doesn't seem confident about a way back and she is not the kind of person who is into details.

After some hesitation, Shinobu eventually admits that using the energies from the Kita-Shirahebi Shrine is impossible since the vampire Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade has just arrived in town at that period, and asks Koyomi to allow her to drink some of his blood to regain enough powers to make a portal to the present. Koyomi complies to her request, but decides to spend more time in the past for the meantime.\nAfter prying away Shinobu from possibly molesting his younger self, as they walk along the streets, Koyomi slowly realizes that there may be a reason why they ended up on May 13 eleven years ago—the day after is the day when Mayoi Hachikuji died from a car accident while trying to make her way to her mother's house. At first, Koyomi thought of intervening with the problems of Hitagi, Tsubasa, Suruga and Nadeko, but realized that their problems are either unrelated to the time frame or, in Tsubasa's case, is too deep to deal with, so Mayoi is the only option left. Shinobu supports Koyomi's stand, but warns Koyomi that there is no guarantee of success in his plan.\nWith Shinobu dangling on Koyomi's neck, the two begin their search of the Tsunade Residence where Mayoi is supposed to be heading. By sheer chance, they meet none other than Tsubasa Hanekawa, who at that time is only six years old. As he restrains himself from doing anything questionable to the young Tsubasa, Koyomi asks for directions to the Tsunade Residence. Tsubasa manages to trick Koyomi and Shinobu into heading the local police outpost, but Koyomi takes the chance to ask for directions. Using a map given to them from the outpost, they reach the Tsunade Residence that night.\nThe next morning, Koyomi spent the rest of the day near the Hachikuji Residence, where he and Shinobu, who wears a middle school uniform as a disguise, wait for Mayoi to come out. Soon, a middle-aged man asks them about seeing a girl wearing pigtails and a big backpack who went missing since early morning that day. Koyomi, shocked to discover that Mayoi ran away from home earlier than anticipated, frantically hurries to where the accident would happen. Shinobu soon finds Mayoi near the town map in Namishiro Park, and Koyomi decides to personally accompany her to the Tsunade Residence to avoid any trouble. Ironically, Mayoi is frightened by Koyomi's sudden skirt flip and begins running through the nearby streets. Then, as Mayoi finds herself in front of a speeding truck, Koyomi manages to push Mayoi away from harm while keeping himself alive aside from some minor injuries. As planned, he then helps Mayoi get to the Tsunade Residence safely.\nThat night, Koyomi and Shinobu prepare to head back to the present by going to the Kita-Shirahebi Shrine, which is surprisingly still in ruins unlike what they expected of it.

Shinobu is sure that they arrived at the correct date, but upon returning to his home Koyomi finds out that no one else is home. After spending the next five hours checking every single house in the vicinity, the two realize that the world has been destroyed due to Shinobu's time travel and Koyomi's altering of the past. Although Koyomi is still in disbelief, he tries to pin down the cause of the sudden worldwide event, and he initially assumes that an oddity caused the destruction of the world. Despite being troubled due to unknown reasons, Shinobu agrees to cooperate with Koyomi in determining the cause of the incident, and suggests traveling to June 14, where the incident was supposed to have happened.\nOn the way to Kita-Shirahebi Shrine, Shinobu notices that the temple complex is complete void of energy, and Koyomi notices an amulet, a different kind from the one given to him by Meme Oshino. Shinobu explains that this amulet absorbs the surrounding energies, robbing them of a convenient chance of making a portal back to the past to investigate.\nSoon, the two are surrounded by zombies who, for some reason, are repelled by the amulet in the shrine. Shinobu does not want to take any chances and suggests leaving the temple. With a big jump, she and Koyomi manage to elude the zombies, but the aerial view has revealed that the entire town is filled by the former inhabitants of the town, transformed into oddity-like entities. Shinobu then eventually reveals that the zombies are actually humans transformed into vampires, and that Shinobu herself was the cause of it.\nKoyomi and Shinobu let the sun rise before exploring the surface once again and they return to the Araragi Residence afterwards. Here, Shinobu remembers that she, or rather Shinobu Oshino of that timeline, destroyed the world on June 14, the day of Koyomi's first date with Hitagi and the day where something substantial happened to Tsubasa Hanekawa. She reveals that the idea of destroying the world crossed her mind when she had gone missing at that time, and due to Koyomi's intervention over Mayoi's death, Mayoi wasn't the trigger to finding Shinobu, and Koyomi would have ended up killed by Black Hanekawa. Koyomi's death only allowed Shinobu's powers to return to normal, and she begins turning every human in the world into vampires before killing herself some time after, turning those vampires into zombies. Shinobu apologizes for causing such destruction in the world Koyomi is living in, but he rejects her apology, pointing out that it was a different Shinobu Oshino who needs to be responsible for the incident, and instead, suggests in starting to live in the ruined town as survivors.\nAfter a short visit to the nearby department store to acquire supplies, Koyomi decides to light up some fireworks in order to look for other survivors. Three days later, in a cloudy afternoon, Koyomi's fireworks light up the sky, and he and Shinobu wait at Namishiro Park for any responses. To their shock, all that came to their presence are the zombies wandering around town."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Second Season Episode 10: Mayoi Jiangshi, Part 4","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Season_Episode_10:_Mayoi_Jiangshi,_Part_4","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Cultural_References"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Mayoi Jiangshi, Part 4\" (まよいキョンシー 其ノ肆, Mayoi Kyonshī Sono Yon) is the tenth episode of the Monogatari Series Second Season anime series, released on September 7, 2013.

After finding out that he is Koyomi Araragi, Mayoi hands over a letter from a man named Oshino, who also taught her on how to combat vampires.\nIn the letter, Meme Oshino explained that he was able to learn about what is going on through gathering the many clues scattered through time, and that Koyomi and Shinobu landed on a different timeline in their attempts to time travel. Meanwhile, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade is still alive after failing to kill herself, and has left failed \"clones\" of herself wandering around the world. Oshino stated that he, a violent onmyouji and a conman are preparing on a final assault against the powerful vampire regardless of the outcome. At the end, he asks the two to save the world as a selfish request, and tells them that they are the only ones who can stop Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade.\nMayoi decides to ask the two to come over to her mother's house to take refuge. However, Koyomi decides to refuse her offer. Instead of saving the world, he and Shinobu choose to confront Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade despite being much weaker than her.\nAfter preparing the Kokorowatari in their possession, Koyomi and Shinobu make their ascent to Kita-Shirahebi Shrine, where Shinobu plans to call out Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade. As she expected, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade arrives, her clothes tattered after attempting to burn herself to death. Shinobu cannot help but pity herself for failing so much that desperation consumed her. On the other hand, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade pities herself for being shown a possibility that could have been available to her by allowing a compromise.\nWithout any opposition, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade decides to give them a chance to return to their present time by offering herself to be converted into energy required to make another portal. Shinobu initially questions her decision, but eventually decides to comply to her request. Meanwhile, Koyomi realizes that Meme did not state anything about \"defeating\" Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade and their mere presence was enough to change the powerful vampire's mind. After fulfilling the vampire's request of having her head petted, Shinobu sucks the blood of Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade.\nMoments later, Koyomi wakes up on Shinobu's lap as they return to their present time, although it is also the start of class for Koyomi.

However, due to the remnants of his vampiric nature, Koyomi is left unfazed by Hitagi's show of force towards him. Eventually, Hitagi agrees to let Koyomi help her deal with her weightlessness by joining him to an acquaintance of Koyomi's, Meme Oshino, a specialist in oddities.\nMeme pinpoints the cause of Hitagi's condition to an oddity known as omoishikani, but refuses to \"help\" mainly because her case happens with the consent of the victim. Instead, he only wants to offer a lending hand. After asking Hitagi to return after cleansing her body and wearing clean clothes, Meme begins a ritual that aims to manifest the omoishikani to facilitate Hitagi in requesting the return of her weight. Although the omoishikani appears as expected, it reacts aggressively towards Hitagi's tense state of mind. Despite this, Hitagi proceeds with regaining the memories of her mother that she threw away. In return, she finds Koyomi as his newest friend.\nKoyomi soon realizes that he has been rambling about Hitagi's story up to halfway into the episode, and soon increases the tempo by introducing Mayoi Hachikuji's story, that begins on Mother's Day, May 14, and explores her circumstances as an oddity that appears only to those who refuse to return home, and her successful \"return home\", as well as Hitagi confessing her feelings for Koyomi.\nFollowing Mayoi's story is the story of Suruga Kanbaru, a self-proclaimed lesbian with a bandaged left hand which acts violently towards its host's wishes. Formerly a close friend of Hitagi's who was recently rejected and later learned of her relationship with Koyomi, Kanbaru targets Koyomi while being influenced by her mysterious left hand, which allows her to manifest as a Rainy Devil. To overturn the Rainy Devil, Koyomi is forced to confront Kanbaru again, which eventually triggered a reunion between Kanbaru and Hitagi. Although Kanbaru's left arm remains the same, Hitagi and Kanbaru manage to reconcile in the end.\nAfter Kanbaru's situation is resolved, Koyomi meets a girl from his childhood, Nadeko Sengoku, who is inflicted by a curse that leaves scale marks around her body and is in the middle of desperately curing the curse. Meme identifies the curse as the jagirinawa, an oddity borne from another person's malice, which in Nadeko's case, stemmed from a failed love affair. As Koyomi's attempts to save Nadeko bring him closer to danger, Meme reminds Koyomi that he will leave soon, bringing along his convenient advice, and he always has the option to return to living a normal human life by leaving behind Shinobu.\nKoyomi finally runs out of time explaining the events of the past and instead ends the episode by recalling his first official date with Hitagi.\nThat leaves the playful sawarineko for another day!"},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Second Season Episode 12: Nadeko Medusa, Part 1","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Season_Episode_12:_Nadeko_Medusa,_Part_1","toc":["#Synopsis",{"#Characters":["#New_Characters"]},"#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Referbacks"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"\"Nadeko Medusa, Part 1\" (なでこメドゥーサ 其ノ壹, Nadeko Medūsa Sono Ichi) is the twelfth episode of the Monogatari Series Second Season anime series, first broadcast on September 21, 2013.

Nadeko soon realizes that it was she who delivered those wounds to Koyomi, and Shinobu appears to echo Meme's previous concerns over Nadeko, who is now an oddity with white snakes for hair. After removing Koyomi's hesitations, Shinobu joins him in a joint attack against Nadeko. However, despite their combined might, Shinobu is swatted away while Nadeko drives a spike through Koyomi's heart.\nTurning back to October 31st, Nadeko, who remains depressed over the events of June, meets Ougi Oshino by chance. Nadeko is apprehensive of Ougi because of the unusual greeting and the abrupt mention of her name despite not being familiar to Nadeko. Despite the failed greeting, Ougi, who introduces herself as Meme Oshino's niece, begins a conversation with Nadeko, bringing up the topic about Nadeko's involvement with an oddity and advising Nadeko to stop acting like a victim. Afterwards, Ougi leaves on her bicycle, leaving Nadeko perplexed as if time was stolen from her. Regardless, she heads to her school as usual.\nAfter a momentary hallucination of having a white snake twined around her arm, Nadeko returns to her \"depressing\" school life with Class 2-2 of Nanahyakuichi Public Middle School, which continues to blame the conman Deishuu Kaiki for their problems. In reality, Kaiki's selling of false magic charms to the middle school students in town only caused minor financial impact to the victims, especially those in Nanahyakuichi Public Middle School. However, the string of incidents exposed the sentiments of the students towards each other, causing Class 2-2 to exude a kind of tension that is hidden by a superficially peaceful appearance.\nLater that day, Nadeko calls Koyomi about her sightings of snakes. Without any clues to what causes the hallucinations, Koyomi is forced to rely on Shinobu in her case. Although Nadeko is cautious of Shinobu, she agrees to wait until 10 PM.\nThen, in a slip of the tongue, Nadeko voices out her enthusiasm.\nKoyomi, puzzled by her reaction to being involved again with an oddity, assumes that Nadeko is also confused. Running out of options, Nadeko decides to hang up.\nAs Nadeko tries to regain her composure, she begins hearing the voice of a man from the phone she just used, followed by small snakes spilling out of the phone's mouthpiece. Here, the voice asks Nadeko to come to Kita-Shirahebi Shrine, where he claims to teach Nadeko about the things she is trampling on to maintain a normal life. Nadeko eventually complies, and the voice soon persecutes her for killing the many snakes that now adorn a tree in Kira-Shirahebi Shrine. However, the voice gives Nadeko a chance to atone for her wrongdoings. The voice, who calls himself Kuchinawa, soon appears as a large white snake coiled around the shrine complex, and asks a favor from Nadeko.\nNadeko realizes that she would say yes to Kuchinawa regardless of whatever happens to her and thus, finds herself moving closer to an inevitable battle against Koyomi."},"#New_Characters":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Referbacks":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Second Season Episode 13: Nadeko Medusa, Part 2","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Season_Episode_13:_Nadeko_Medusa,_Part_2","toc":["#Synopsis",{"#Characters":["#New_Characters"]},"#Locations","#Music","#Trivia","#Quotes"],"Description":"","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Sasayabu"],"text":"After calling Koyomi to lie to him about no longer seeing the white snakes from earlier, Nadeko reveals that she chose to cooperate with Kuchinawa, who wants Nadeko to help him locate his corpse.

Despite this, Nadeko does not back down on her word, but prefers to do the search while maintaining her normal school attendance.\nSoon, Kuchinawa learns from Nadeko's homeroom teacher Sasayabu that Nadeko is her class' representative, but only because nobody else in the class wanted to take up the position, and that she is tasked with resolving the current tension in the class.

This, however, puts Tsukihi into disbelief, as it implies that Nadeko is contented with showing her affection towards Koyomi without actually being lovers with him. As if losing her patience over someone who could have gotten enough support by fighting for her feelings, Tsukihi runs with a pair of scissors and cuts down Nadeko's forelocks.\nA distraught Nadeko laments over the loss of her cherished bangs.

However, Koyomi's calm approach is overcome by Shinobu's harsher chastising of Nadeko's character.\nKoyomi tried to warn Shinobu about provoking Nadeko, but it came too late, as Nadeko quickly puts the talisman into her mouth. Immediately, Nadeko's eyes burn red and her hair turns into countless white snakes that quickly overwhelmed Shinobu. Then, as Nadeko becomes filled with rage, she summons a needle-like harpoon and stabs Koyomi many times.\nThis encounter happens once again in Kita-Shirahebi Shrine, with both Koyomi and Shinobu defeated by a snake god that came into life for the first time after Nadeko ate the talisman entrusted to Koyomi—a snake god fueled by Nadeko's own delusions.\nAs Kuchinawa begins to persuade Nadeko to know more about the truth, Nadeko allows Kuchinawa to tell her about how her delusions have started. Kuchinawa complies, and he reveals that the moment in early September when she learned about Koyomi having a girlfriend was the incident that started everything, although she was already prone to contact with oddities ever since she had one exorcised off her in the past. Nadeko soon met a person named Ougi Oshino, who gave her the white scrunchie and told her about a talisman in Koyomi's care. Thus, the story about \"atoning for the white snakes she sacrificed\" was only an alibi. Moreover, the one instance when Nadeko was able to open the locked doors of the Araragi Residence was because of a planned attempt to sneak into the house itself using the house keys, with some help from Tsukihi.\nWith everything settled, Nadeko wonders about what to do with Koyomi now that he and Shinobu are no longer a threat. Thinking that killing him would fulfill her wish of having an unrequited love, she prepares her harpoon at him.\nThen, Koyomi's phone rings.\nNadeko picks up the phone and the familiar voice of Hitagi Senjougahara emerges from the other line, asking about Koyomi's condition. After hearing that Koyomi is still alive (albeit barely), Hitagi makes a request involving Koyomi.

However, Shinobu Oshino, the remnant of a vampire he found in a donut shop, eventually rescued Koyomi and Tsubasa before beginning to reside on his own shadow.\nThe following day, Koyomi could no longer find Meme Oshino, the man who once brought back his life as a human. To his surprise, Meme's last words about not going without a goodbye was a parting message in itself, something that he only realized after Meme had gone.\nSeveral days after, during early summer vacation, Koyomi found himself locked away in a classroom-like place, where Hitagi had him in chains after hearing that he met a man named Kaiki, which Hitagi identified as the first of five conmen who swindled her family. Hitagi planned to prevent a direct encounter between him and Kaiki, but it was foiled by one made by his younger sister Karen, whose strong sense of justice forced her to deal with the charms circulating across town personally, at the cost of being taken down by the conman's curses herself. As Koyomi brought himself closer to reconciling with Shinobu, he decided to intervene with Karen's case, which eventually became an issue involving Hitagi's past as well. In the end, Kaiki agreed to leave town after hearing directly from Hitagi. As a result, Hitagi became even closer to Koyomi while Koyomi's relationship with his siblings improved.\nTwo weeks later, Koyomi and Shinobu meet an oddity specialist named Yozuru Kagenui and her familiar Yotsugi Ononoki, both of which came to town to target Koyomi's youngest sibling Tsukihi, which they identify as an immortal oddity. In order to protect what he believes is his sister regardless of her origin, Koyomi and Shinobu fought Yozuru and Yotsugi. Even as Yozuru overwhelmed Koyomi and Shinobu merely toyed with Yotsugi, Koyomi was able to plead for Tsukihi's life.

Worse, Koyomi is late for the start-of-term ceremony and he has yet to return Mayoi's backpack.\nAfter having a short conversation about Mayoi having the impression of a slug (a snail without it's shell, that is her backpack), she and Koyomi head to the Araragi Residence, where Koyomi had to dash to pick up Mayoi's backpack. The two are about to engage in their usual advance, but Mayoi (and eventually Koyomi) is taken aback by something that can be perceived, but cannot be seen, something that he describes as \"darkness\" (kurayami).\nKoyomi picks up Mayoi on a frantic escape by bike to elude the invisible threat. However, because of the inability to perceive and understand the \"darkness\", Koyomi finds it hard to run away from the unknown entity and Mayoi loses one of her hair ties and part of her left sleeve in the process. Eventually, the \"darkness\" consumes their bike, just as Yotsugi Ononoki discovers the two in their escape. Although Yotsugi fails to understand their current dilemma, she agrees to help Koyomi and the now unconscious Mayoi escape.

Koyomi is no oddity specialist to pinpoint it, and Yotsugi implies that it would be easier to deal with it if it was simply \"darkness\". Without the proper knowledge about their latest threat, Koyomi chooses to wait until evening where Shinobu can be active and to ask Tsubasa about anything she could know about the \"darkness\".

Before then, she resided in a lavish castle she constructed from her own powers and would stir the clouds to make it rain at random intervals. Despite this lavish lifestyle, Shinobu eventually regretted accepting such a break in her life, since she isn't treated like a vampire but instead like a god, and her powers aren't restored because the locale did not have any tales about vampires.\nSoon, a man who first wielded the Kokorowatari and another sword called the Yumewatari, the person Shinobu only called as an \"oddity killer\", appeared, but only to make a harmless visit. As the visits became frequent, Shinobu became careless not only of her urges to suck blood, but also of her tendency to gather energies that eventually became oddities themselves. Eventually, due to various incidents, the people of the town that worshiped her as a god vanished. Shinobu later found out that something else was responsible for the disappearances, and it was only triggered by Shinobu's prolonged stay in the area.

On the other hand, Izuko has minced her words about the \"darkness\", but she also wants Koyomi to not worry because he is currently safe at the moment.\nFor the meantime, Izuko asks for three favors before she would agree to provide Koyomi with the information he wants: first, to introduce her to Suruga Gaen (currently Suruga Kanbaru); second, to help Yotsugi in her pending task; and third, to ask Suruga's help in the second request.\nAfter Koyomi agreed to fulfill the three requests, Izuko decides to bring her end of the favor, although she demands him to stay where they are, particularly because the target of the \"darkness\" is none other than Mayoi herself. Izuko explains that the \"darkness\" is a non-existence whose main purpose is to consume any oddity that has strayed off from the right path.\n400 years ago, the \"darkness\" came to Shinobu Oshino (then the vampire Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade) for lying about being a god despite being a vampire. However, she managed to escape the \"darkness\" by creating her first minion and returning to her nature as a vampire. At the present, however, Mayoi becomes the target for lying about remaining on the living world despite supposedly having moved on. In addition to this, she is also not doing her role as the oddity called the \"lost cow\" either, as Koyomi had never experienced getting lost even with Mayoi accompanying her. The only moments where he did get lost were, coincidentally, the moments during the descent, where Mayoi is unconscious, which are also moments when the \"darkness\" isn't pursuing them.\nKoyomi pushes Izuko for a way to defeat the \"darkness\", but Izuko points out that they are dealing with a law, something that wouldn't move to mere words. Mayoi then decides that the only way to deal with the \"darkness\" is if she, as a ghost, would disappear.\nIzuko leaves Koyomi and Mayoi, while Yotsugi decides to accompany them. Mayoi is trying to accept that her time is now limited and urges Koyomi to move on from having happy moments with her. Koyomi remains stubborn, and even considers allowing Mayoi to return to being the lost cow. However, Mayoi rejects his plan of wasting twenty years of his life for her sake, especially with Hitagi, Tsubasa, Karen, Tsukihi and Shinobu to consider.\nEven to the end, Koyomi remains hardheaded about her decision. Still, he eventually agrees to do their usual exchange, ending with Mayoi biting her tongue.\nHowever, as Koyomi faces Mayoi, she goes for a kiss, apologizes for biting her tongue, then confesses her feelings for Koyomi.\nFour months later, Koyomi tells the story following Mayoi's journey to the afterlife to Ougi Oshino inside Naoetsu Private High School. As agreed upon, Koyomi asked Suruga's assistance in helping Yotsugi complete her mission, one which Koyomi thinks was bigger than the incident with the \"darkness\". Koyomi admits that he still feels that there might have been another way to deal with the \"darkness\", but Ougi lauds Mayoi's brave decision to move on instead of risking being devoured.\nOugi leaves after thanking Koyomi for the story, returning to her \"work\", which she likens to \"darkness\" and \"punishing liars\".\nKoyomi reveals his plan about keeping Mayoi's passing on a secret to everyone except for Ougi and Yotsugi to Shinobu, and wonders about its outcome, although he expects Tsubasa to find out about it soon.

As Deishuu claims victory from Hitagi, Hitagi begins to talk about the deal, as well as the need for him to accept the deal. In fear of getting stabbed by Hitagi's school supplies, Kaiki agrees to listen, but he also wonders why Hitagi chose to use her last winter break to perform a scam on a girl named Nadeko Sengoku instead of spending it with Koyomi.

Although hearing those words have made Deishuu somewhat glad, he remains hesitant to fully accept the deal, especially without hearing about Hitagi paying him money for it. Even still, he did not accept the one hundred thousand yen Hitagi prepared for him and even tells her to fall back on Meme, who had helped her in the past. However, with Meme's whereabouts still unknown, to the point that even Tsubasa Hanekawa had to go abroad to look for him, Hitagi urges Deishuu to accept the deal, even with a larger sum of money involved... even if she had to sell her body to compensate. In response, Deishuu spills his coffee on Hitagi's face, and heads to the toilet for a moment to gather himself.\nIn the end, Deishuu finds no interest to save either Koyomi or Hitagi, to deceive Nadeko, or to even involve himself with Tsubasa.

Hitagi believes that the mere fact that she was able to talk to Deishuu in spite of her rage is enough proof that Nadeko is willing to wait. The conman soon wonders about the cause of Nadeko's rage, but even Hitagi does not know, and could only infer based on Tsubasa's speculation that it is something related to romance.\nUnderstanding the current situation, both Hitagi and Deishuu agree to a compromise.

Deishuu also notices that Hitagi is still adamant about dealing with Nadeko alone.\nSoon, Deishuu asks about Hitagi whether she would bring her bag with her when going out for a phone call while in a public gathering. Hitagi answers that doing such a thing is rude to her companions, and Deishuu responds by explaining that Nadeko gives off the impression of someone who would do the exact opposite in that case.

However, Deishuu lied about pulling out right after receiving the three million yen compensation, and saw no regrets to it, as he personally saw Izuko as an enemy of sorts.\nLater that day, as promised, he visits Nadeko and plans to teach her some cat's cradle patterns. However, Deishuu is taken aback now that he has to teach cat's cradle by using a white snake eating its tail as a string. Then, afterwards, after shaking off the feeling of being watched by someone, he travels to the Sengoku residence, not to meet Nadeko's parents again, but to find more clues pointing to why Nadeko is such a mentally unstable state.\nAs soon as he opens Nadeko's previously unreachable closet, Deishuu is flabbergasted."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Second Season Episode 24: Hitagi End, Part 4","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Season_Episode_24:_Hitagi_End,_Part_4","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music","#Trivia","#Quotes"],"Description":"","#Synopsis":{"link":[],"text":"Deishuu Kaiki returns to his locked hotel room when he finds a note telling him to \"stay out of it\". As he takes a shower, he begins to wonder about who his current enemy is (who is capable to barging into a locked hotel room), although he insists that his only enemy at the moment is the god Nadeko Sengoku.\nAfter the shower, Deishuu contacts Hitagi and he asks her if there were people who attempted to interfere with their deal, after which Deishuu retells his conversation with Ononoki and Izuko Gaen's message for him. Deishuu soon learns from Hitagi that although she hasn't met Izuko personally, she knows from Koyomi and Tsubasa that it was Izuko's talisman that was responsible for Nadeko's transformation into a god, and Hitagi points out that Izuko took no effort to keep Koyomi away from the case.\nIzuko's actions towards him, Tsubasa and Koyomi in different circumstances made Deishuu to suspect that Izuko fears about the possibility that he would fail to deceive Nadeko, but only because of the ensuing rampage that would follow. Still, he does not understand why a second warning is needed.\nHitagi, however, suspects that the one who issued him a warning in his hotel room might not be related to Nadeko's case and might be one of his direct victims. She wanted to do her part in the case by helping determine this unknown character, but Deishuu refuses, mainly because he already disposed of the note and he wanted to deal with what might be a direct hindrance to the job (although he commends Hitagi for not being complacent towards him).\nSoon, Hitagi wonders about Deishuu's plan to make the 100 visits to Kita-Shirahebi Shrine as he promised to Nadeko. Deishuu only makes sure to visit her for 30 days, which will still cost a tenth of what he received from Izuko, and asks if Hitagi is jealous of his religious visits, causing her to drop the line immediately. Deishuu quickly apologizes, and Hitagi clarifies that she is cautious because she sees Nadeko as charming, and it's something Hitagi only believes because she hasn't met her personally.\nAfter that conversation, Deishuu scribbles his additional plans before ending the day.\nOn January 4, after buying thread to keep Nadeko from using her white snakes in cat's cradle, Deishuu plans to bring something else aside from his usual 10,000 yen donation to Nadeko. Ignoring that Nadeko was once a middle school girl, Deishuu chooses to buy bottles of sake for her. Afterwards, he heads to Kita-Shirahebi Shrine and, to the shock of the god Nadeko, offers 20,000 yen for his visit.\nDeishuu descends as soon as he makes his usual cat's cradle lessons with Nadeko. There, at the entrance of the temple, Tsubasa Hanekawa greets him and introduces herself. Despite his own impressions about Tsubasa, he opens a conversation with her. Here, Tsubasa reveals that she did go overseas, but went home sooner than either Koyomi or Hitagi knows; she did it not only because she believes that Meme Oshino is still in Japan, but also to give herself some space, especially from people like Izuko Gaen. For now, her flights away from Japan is to trick Izuko, even if the trick doesn't last long, as well as to motivate Hitagi to make decisions on her own, which ultimately led to her request to Deishuu. Tsubasa is glad that, despite some inaccuracies, her plan worked in the end.\nTsubasa decides to continue their talk in a room she rented for herself. Here, she voices out her willingness for Koyomi and Hitagi to be saved, regardless of who does the deed. She also sees it unnecessary to ask about Deishuu's reasons to accept the job... Tsubasa does not know everything, only what she knows, after all."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Trivia":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Second Season Episode 25: Hitagi End, Part 5","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Season_Episode_25:_Hitagi_End,_Part_5","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music","#Trivia","#Quotes"],"Description":"","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kiss-shot_Acerola-orion_Heart-under-blade","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Rouka_Numachi"],"text":"With the help of Tsubasa's wealth of information, Deishuu Kaiki finally gets a firm grasp of the situation better than relying on Hitagi's knowledge alone. There, he understood that Izuko Gaen is trying to stabilize the town's spiritual power (which caused Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade to come to the town), and it involved turning the vampire into the god of Kita-Shirahebi Shrine. However, Koyomi refused, and an innocent girl became the god instead.\nDeishuu takes this opportunity to talk to Tsubasa about her impression of Nadeko. Tsubasa, in turn, describes her as a girl who ignores everything else around her and lives in a closed-off world. She also believes that Nadeko does not love Koyomi despite what the latter claims. Despite this, Tsubasa harbors a selfish wish to save Nadeko, although she refuses to do it after Deishuu has dealt with her god problem.\nAfter learning from Deishuu that Meme Oshino is a person who does not have any known relatives (especially a niece), Tsubasa tells Deishuu about a closet in Nadeko's room that even Koyomi is forbidden to open. Deishuu faked his ignorance about the issue, and manages to end the conversation while keeping mum about the thing he found inside Nadeko's closet.\nDeishuu eventually spends the next few days playing with Nadeko, and soon gives her koma tops, wooden building blocks, and a den-den daiko to play with, along with the occasional bottle of sake to drink. By mid-January, Deishuu also visits the ruins of a cram school that served as Meme Oshino's former home, and meets a girl named Rouka Numachi.\nTwo more weeks later, at the first day of February, Deishuu makes one of his last two reports to Hitagi, and tells her to prepare a toast for managing to survive the ordeal. However, Deishuu warns Hitagi that Koyomi remains to be a factor in the plan, and a careless move from him will undo all of Deishuu's efforts. Hitagi knows that Koyomi cannot be easily swayed, and Deishuu wants Hitagi to use the month of February to woo over Koyomi, the same way he got close to Nadeko.\nSoon, Hitagi finally decides to express her gratitude for accepting her request. However, she points out that the request will not invalidate her life-long grudge against him, and she still demands Deishuu to stay out of town. Deishuu assures Hitagi that he never breaks promises, and soon leaves his hotel room as Hitagi says that he hasn't lied to her likewise.\nDeishuu soon meets Yotsugi by chance in the nearby train station, although Yotsugi is there as herself and not as Izuko Gaen's messenger. Yotsugi opens a conversation about the motivations for his job to deceive Nadeko Sengoku, and she reveals that she was also involved with a case related to crushing an evil cult that destroyed Hitagi's family. Yotsugi echoes Izuko's worries about Deishuu's tendency to fail—just like when his intervention over the Senjougahara family issue had cost a family their matriarch—even if she herself believes that Deishuu's chances of success in deceiving Nadeko are high.\nThe words of the tsukumogami cause Deishuu to reminisce about two years ago, and he quickly returns to Kita-Shirahebi Shrine to meet Nadeko Sengoku. There, as Nadeko asks Deishuu about what his wish from way back in his first visit, Deishuu explains that he refuses to say his wish because wishes made into words can no longer be granted, and he relates it to Nadeko vocally speaking about her wish to kill Koyomi.\nAt that moment, Deishuu Kaiki says that Koyomi Araragi and Hitagi Senjougahara were killed in a car accident, rendering her wish useless.\nHowever, Nadeko Sengoku only smiles, as if expecting him to deceive her."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Trivia":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Second Season Episode 26: Hitagi End, Part 6","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Season_Episode_26:_Hitagi_End,_Part_6","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music",{"#Trivia":["#Unanswered_Questions"]},"#Quotes"],"Description":"","#Synopsis":{"link":[],"text":"After a month of preparation, Deishuu Kaiki fails to deceive Nadeko Sengoku, as he realized that she never trusted him to begin with. He realizes the truth behind Tsubasa's impressions of Nadeko's character as countless white snakes flood the shrine grounds. Meanwhile, Nadeko triumphantly watches as Deishuu is surrounded by her white snakes.\nDeishuu tries to reason out to Nadeko, and begins comparing her to a girl he worked with before, who instead of taking the assistance of a god decides to walk a more difficult route, and even repays help with resentment.\nHowever, those words did not reach Nadeko. Instead, she begins blaming someone else... particularly a certain Ougi.\nHearing the name Ougi makes Deishuu wonder if there is someone else who motivated Nadeko into becoming the god of Kita-Shirahebi Shrine... or deceived her into becoming one. Meanwhile, Nadeko's rage is slowly emerging as she slowly plans to kill more than the three people she declared to kill months before.\nThen, amidst this rage, Deishuu wonders if Nadeko wanted to become something else instead of being the god of Kita-Shirahebi Shrine. As soon as he mutters the words \"manga artist\", Nadeko's expression quickly changes to the face of a flustered girl who was suddenly exposed. All of Nadeko's white snakes cease moving, and she resorts to beating Deishuu physically; as she does so, Deishuu reveals that he snuck into Nadeko's closet and he fights back by overloading Nadeko's puzzled head with how he saw Nadeko's immense material for a manga concept.\nEmbarrassed by the exposé, Nadeko threatens to kill Deishuu for exposing the truth, then herself out of sheer embarrassment. However, he points out that it will not stop anyone else from seeing her manuscripts. Deishuu also adds that no one else knows about her work, and he considers it her wish, something that she does not materialize into words. He also disagrees that making something is something to use to belittle oneself. However, he argues that she cannot make the things she wants by being a god.\nSoon, Deishuu rambles on about his own character:\n\"Sengoku, I like money. I'll tell you why. It's because money can take the place of everything. You can buy things. You can buy lives. You can buy people. You can buy hearts. You can buy happiness. You can buy dreams. It's very precious, but on top of that, it's not something that is irreplaceable. That's why I like it. Conversely, I hate irreplaceable things. 'I can't live without this.' Or 'that is the reason why I'm alive.' Or 'that is the purpose of which I was born.' Putting scarcity value on things like that piss me off to no end.\"\nDeishuu then asks if Nadeko is willing to value her feelings for Koyomi despite having a lot more options in life. Nadeko remains aggressive over Deishuu's way of speaking to her, to the point that he spat blood after being kicked and punched by her. Still, he continues on talking to Nadeko, urging her to return to humanity because it is the only option for someone like her with a talent for drawing. Eventually, Nadeko considers taking up Deishuu's challenge, and he decides to leave behind his donations over the past month (about 300,000 yen) for Nadeko to buy professional drawing tools.\nLastly, to complete his task, Deishuu asks Nadeko if she could agree to be deceived by him. Upon agreeing, Nadeko is touched by Deishuu on the forehead, just in time for Koyomi Araragi to see the two.\nAfter Koyomi is shocked at the sight of Deishuu in the shrine, Deishuu explains that he came to the town as a ghost-buster under Izuko Gaen's request to exorcise Nadeko, and uses an oddity called a \"slug tofu\" to immobilize her while he personally extracts Izuko's talisman from inside Nadeko's mouth. Deishuu parts ways with Koyomi after handing down the talisman to his hands, warning him to not make a mistake involving the talisman again. He also tells Koyomi that the slug tofu will disappear in three days' time.\nKoyomi asks Deishuu about his plans now that his work is done. Deishuu still plans to leave town as Hitagi demanded, and he personally asks Koyomi to stay out of Nadeko's life, as her current problem stems from her obsession over Koyomi. As Koyomi stands helpless, Deishuu assures Koyomi that Nadeko only needs to live, and good things might come to her eventually.\nDeishuu makes his last call to Hitagi after leaving Kira-Shirahebi Shrine. Hitagi expresses her thanks for the last time, and asks if Deishuu has thought that she had developed feelings for her two years ago in what she claims as an \"act of deception\" from her. Then, Deishuu ends the call by implying to Hitagi that he knows that it was her who wrote that letter on his hotel room a few weeks ago, something that notes is contrary to her intentions, but was a sign that Hitagi knows him very well. He also feels that Izuko's actions also imply that she also knows about his character too. That leaves Meme Oshino, who remains unseen despite being expected to come at this kind of problem.\nSuddenly, Deishuu is hit by someone on the head. As he loses blood, alone, in the middle of a wintry forest, he realizes that the assailant was the middle school boy responsible for Nadeko's infliction of a snake-like curse in the first place, now suffering from a curse that returned to him. Deishuu hears the unfamiliar name of Ougi from him, and he tries to gather his thoughts despite his injury.\nThen, the boy attacks again, and Deishuu Kaiki is left to bleed alone under the falling snow."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Unanswered_Questions":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Seishirou Shishirui","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Seishirou_Shishirui","toc":["#Appearance","#Personality","#Background",{"#Plot":["#Koyomi_Vamp","#Shinobu_Time","#Shinobu_Mail"]},"#Trivia",{"#Appears_In":["#Main_Series","#Manga"]}],"Description":"Seishirou Shishirui (死屍累 生死郎, Shishirui Seishirō) was Shinobu Oshino's first vampire minion and the original oddity slayer.

She now takes the form of an eight-year-old girl with another new name after losing most of her powers.\nShe is the titular protagonist of five main arcs: Shinobu Time, Shinobu Mail, Acerola Bon Appétit, Shinobu Mastered and Shinobu Suicide, and four minor arcs: Shinobu House, Shinobu Science, Shinobu Figure, and Princess Beauty.","#Name":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Deathtopia_Virtuoso_Suicide-Master","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kizumonogatari","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Meme_Oshino","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi_Vamp","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsubasa_Hanekawa","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Seishirou_Shishirui"],"text":"Shinobu Oshino is the \"human name\" of the vampire Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade. She generally is called this, depending on the person talking about her or her power level at the time. This vampire name was conceived by Deathtopia Virtuoso Suicide-Master, who was very proud of how meaningful the name is.\nKiss-Shot, the 'first name', is a reference to the fairy tale of cursed princesses being healed by a kiss from a prince. This also mirrors Araragi, who saved her from death, and became her 'prince'. Also, \"Kiss-shot\" is a reference to the Japanese deity of beauty, Kisshouten, which mirrors her cursed beauty and attempt to become a goddess. Acerola-Orion, the 'middle name', is composed of Acerola, Princess Rola's self given alias after the start of her journey, and Orion, which is a constellation on the equator east of Taurus represented as a hunter with a belt and sword, which reflects her nature as a vampire, that being to hunt and eat humans, as well as furthers Deathtopia's comparison of Princess Acerola to a sword. Finally, Heart-Under-Blade, the 'last name', is born from Deathtopia's impressions of Princess Acerola as a strong woman, like a sword, but with a kind heart. This name is also the inspiration for the name Shinobu (忍), as it is literally made up of the kanji for heart (心) under the kanji for blade (刃). Also, this name is connected with the plot of Kizumonogatari, where her heart was hunted by three vampire hunters, with each of them having wordplay with the word \"blade\" in their names.\nIt is understood that people who have known her, either directly or by reputation, call her by her full vampire name in all cases, exception made of the specialists close to Meme Oshino who was the one to adopt and name her Shinobu after she lost her power following Koyomi Vamp.\nOn the contrary, people close enough to Koyomi Araragi to be aware of her existence refer to her as Shinobu, as her child form is the only one they generally know of (exception made for Tsubasa Hanekawa).\nOnly Koyomi refers to her with both names, generally to referring to her according to her power level. Shinobu herself agrees that being weak changed her personality and that she knows her personality would probably revert to the time of pre-Spring Break during the events of Kizumonogatari if she were to come back to being the powerful vampire she once was. Koyomi generally refers to her as Shinobu intimately, but doesn't hesitate to refer to her by her full vampire name when thinking about her, not wanting to forget her nature nor forgive her actions during Spring Break.\nIntimately, only Koyomi and Seishirou Shishirui called her by the nickname Kiss-shot in front of her. However, most people referring to her vampire nature abridge her name this way behind her back."},"#Appearance":{"link":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aviator_hat","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Bakemonogatari_(manga)"],"text":"Shinobu is a young female with yellow eyes, pointy ears, sharp fangs, and long blond hair which curls outward at the end. During the course of the series, she takes on several changes in appearance depending on how much of her vampire powers she possesses. Through most of the series, she assumes a younger form as an eight year old. She wears a loose white dress and a pair of sandals, with an aviator hat as an accessory in Bakemonogatari. Later on in the series, her eight-year old form occasionally wears dresses of other colors.\nAs demonstrated in Nisemonogatari, she can suck blood to become older; she appears as a girl in her adolescent years, tying her hair into a ponytail and wearing a black camisole inside a purple jacket, a black skirt and black hosiery. In Kizumonogatari, obtaining her stolen body parts causes her to age, along with gradually transforming her clothes into an appearance similar to her adult form. Her true form as Kiss-Shot depicts a woman in her late twenties wearing a red and black dress.\nThe Bakemonogatari manga adaptation portrays the seventeen-year old Kiss-shot having two long ponytails and wearing a black trenchcoat-like uniform. Kiss-shot's true adult form in the manga wears a long black dress with bat ornaments, the clothing occasionally changing in its design throughout the story. When Kiss-shot is fighting Koyomi in the Kizumonogatari arc of the manga, her dress transforms into black demonic armor with spikes and parts of her hair become long horns. It is unknown if the anime or light novel versions of Kiss-shot are able to have these appearances in her different forms."},"#Personality":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Meme_Oshino","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Oddity"],"text":"After losing most of her vampire powers, Shinobu falls into a long period of stupor. She is frequently seen in Oshino's place with her hands tucking her knees in, her face always in an emotionless state. She often spends most of the day in one spot, doing mostly nothing with a bitter expression. Shinobu also does not talk to anyone, but she is familiar with Koyomi Araragi and Meme Oshino, and would follow requests from either of them.\nLater she reverts back to her brighter personality after \"reconciling\" with Koyomi. She is rather talkative, and often asserts her superiority through her archaic speech. She mostly plays with Koyomi's tendency to act as the follower between the two. Sometime after Koyomi Vamp, she appears to find a liking to Mister Donuts and they become her obsession. She refers to herself using \"washi\" (ワシ), which is often used in fictional settings to represent characters of old age.\nShinobu holds affection for Koyomi stemming from him saving her in Koyomi Vamp. She is seen to show jealousy if he spends too much time around other girls or gets too close to those she does not like, notably Nadeko Sengoku. She is shown to be touched by Koyomi being willing to live and die with her, but as called out by Suruga Kanbaru, is initially unwilling to openly return the sentiment until months later in Ougi Dark. When her first minion Seishirou resurfaces, she is concerned that she might choose to return to Seishirou over Koyomi, still having some affection for him, but admits in the end that she wants to stay with Koyomi. Her liking for Koyomi leads to her desiring to restore their master-servant bond whenever it is broken, despite it restricting her abilities and movements.\nDue to being around Meme for many hours while performing her silent treatment, she's obtained a bit of knowledge about different types of oddities, and often helps out Araragi in his time of need, but she still remains as no expert.\nShinobu very rarely refers to anyone by name, with Koyomi showing surprise that she called Tsukihi by hers in Tsukihi Phoenix. Instead she refers to most people by nicknames, such as calling Hitagi \"tsundere girl\"."},"#Background":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Anime_Monogatari_Series_Heroine_Book_3:_Shinobu","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Wazamonogatari"],"text":"Shinobu's past from before she became a vampire is revealed in \"Princess Beauty\" (うつくし姫 Utsukushihime), published in Anime Monogatari Series Heroine Book 3: Shinobu. It was later included in Wazamonogatari.\nShe was named Rola (possibly meant to be either Laura, Lola, or Lora in English) and was the only daughter of a noble family in an unspecified foreign kingdom outside of Japan. Her beauty was famous throughout the entire kingdom. Countless people would line up outside her palace everyday just to see her. Anyone who sees her for the first time is shocked that her beauty exceeds any expectations, and they would bring her countless gifts everyday. Despite everyone's love for her, Lola was never happy, and she never smiled. She wished people would see what's inside her, instead of just her exterior. One day an elderly witch came to grant her wish. The witch turned her physical appearance invisible, and people could only see her inside.\nHowever, her interior turned out to be far more beautiful than her exterior. Her inner beauty manifested itself as a bright light that enveloped the entire kingdom. After seeing her inner beauty, her father felt extreme guilt for not being able to understand her and see her true self, and killed himself out of this guilt. Her mother was so satisfied by giving birth to such a perfect child, that she felt she had nothing left to do in this world. Thus, she also committed suicide. People were so astounded by her pure heart that instead of giving her material gifts they gave her their most valuable possessions: their lives. If they had things more important to them than their lives, they would give her those instead. (e.g. a musician gave her his ears, a poet gave her his tongue, a sculptor gave her his eyes, and some gave her their children's lives, their grandchildren's lives, etc.). Corpses of those who committed suicide for princess beauty piled up outside her palace. Before long, the pile of corpses grew higher than the palace.\nLola was devastated at the result. The witch couldn't turn her back because she gave Lola her knowledge-filled head (the witch beheaded herself). However, Lola's tear was able to revive the witch for a small moment, and the witch told her to go on a journey. The witch told her to avoid people, and to never stay in one place for too long. Otherwise, people will get drawn to her heart, and start taking their own lives again."},"#Acerola_Bon_App%C3%A9tite":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Koyomi_Vamp":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kizumonogatari","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Eikou_Cram_School","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Guillotine_Cutter","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsubasa_Hanekawa","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Meme_Oshino"],"text":"Kiss-shot arrived in the Japan, the place she met the person who eventually became her first minion, for the second time in her life, looking for a place to die.

After demanding him to give his life in order to let her live, he runs away as she cries for her life. After contemplating, he changes his mind and gives his neck to her, ready to die.\nHe awakes in Eikou Cram School as a vampire and finds the now weakened Kiss-shot had taken the form of a 10 year old girl.

Koyomi Araragi, now a first year university student, goes on the move to track down the culprit! The curtain opens on Monogatari Series: Monster Season!\""},"#Shinobu_Mustard":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Musubimonogatari","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Vampire"],"text":"The Naoetsu High School girls' basketball team has been in a downward spiral ever since their superstar Kanbaru left. Their sense of camaraderie disappeared, and only the burden of “collective responsibility” remained. Practice is too tough, since it was originally designed for the team Kanbaru led to nationals; many want to quit, but nobody wants to be the first one to do it. Some members were affected particularly badly, like Kie Harimaze, whose grades and mental health were both falling. One evening as Harimaze walks home from practice wanting for it all to just end, she's approached by the ancient vampire Deathtopia Virtuoso Suicide-Master—and her prayers are answered.\nKoyomi is in his first year of college, and living at home. He had some trouble involving Sodachi and Hitagi earlier in the year, which Musubimonogatari describes further, if you're interested.\nMultiple girls attending Naoetsu High School have been discovered mummified around town, and Gaen's network is in full force trying to solve the case. She approaches Koyomi for help, offering in exchange to leave him alone for the rest of his college years; he agrees.\nGaen takes him to see the latest mummy, and they find among her belongings a set of flashcards. The flashcards are completely untouched except for one, which contains a series of numbers that they deduce to be some kind of code. Araragi then takes the code to a friend of his from college, Meniko, who solves it to mean the letters “D/S/V”. \nAraragi learns about Shinobu's original master, and thus the speculation is that the code was left either as a calling card by the assailant or as a “dying message” from the victim, in either case implicating Suicide-Master in the series of mummifications.\nBecause all of the victims were on the Naoetsu High School girls' basketball team, Araragi visits Kanbaru to see if she has any useful information. Kanbaru's friend and former teammate Seiu Higasa also attends the meeting. Araragi learns that no less than five of the current members have gone missing, though only he knows that three of them have been discovered as mummies. After he promises to help, Higasa entrusts him with the registry of personal info for all members of the team, which he then takes back to Gaen for analysis.\nThat night, while Araragi is trying to keep Shinobu busy (don't want her learning about Suicide-Master being implicated in a local crime spree), Ononoki appears with a summons from Hachikuji. Hachikuji says has a little girl she would like to introduce to Shinobu, so Araragi and Shinobu make a late-night visit to the shrine, only to find that little girl is actually Suicide-Master—mummified. Hachikuji discovered her buried nearby. This development complicates Suicide-Master's status as the prime suspect, but before any of that, Araragi, Hachikuji, and Shinobu need to revive her. To do so, they plan for Shinobu to kill and revive Araragi with her magic swords so he can retrieve special blood from Hell.\nHowever, when he is torn to pieces by Shinobu's practiced sword techniques in an elaborate Katanagatari reference, he wakes up not in Hell, but in Heaven. Face to face with him is Princess Acerola, naked but for a demon mask. They discuss herself, her regrets, and Suicide-Master; finally, she instructs him to close his eyes, whereupon she removes the mask and imparts a mouthful of her saliva into his mouth. He returns to the real world and unloads the saliva into Suicide-Master's mummified mouth, which begins the healing process. Gaen says this should take about a day, at which point she should be well enough for questioning.\nBut before that, another mummy is discovered, this time with an intact cell phone, and another series of numbers on the screen. Meniko solves this code out to be “F/C”. Those letters prove harder to understand than “D/S/V”, since nobody on the basketball team has those initials, nor do any involved party. Koyomi speculates it might mean “Fan Club”, but after discussing it with Karen and learning that Gaen's network has confirmed the safety of all remaining basketball team members, any suspicion that could have been directed toward Kanbaru's fan club seems to disappear.\nIn order to put on airs of power for her old master, Shinobu asks Araragi to pretend to be her minion, and they choose Kanbaru's traditional Japanese mansion as the location where they will fully revive Suicide-Master to make it seem like Shinobu's own castle. The charade doesn't really work.\nWhile Suicide-Master and Shinobu have their long-awaited reunion, Gaen takes Araragi outside to discuss more developments in the case. The fifth missing girl's personal belongings, including her school uniforms, were discovered in the team's changing room. It's possible this was done by the culprit to hinder the investigation, which would mean that information about the investigation has been leaked to the culprit. She also informs him that DNA analysis has concluded that the vampire genes in the mummies match Suicide-Master's (vampiricism is apparently genetic).\nSuicide-Master tells part of her side of the story. She came to Japan to see Shinobu, and after realizing she'd diminished to the form of a young girl, she wanted to put on airs to meet her old minion. However, she died of “food poisoning”, sucking the blood of a high school girl. But if Suicide-Master turned into a mummy as a result of the first blood she sucked, then she couldn't have carried out the subsequent mummifications. This leads Gaen and Araragi to conclude that a different vampire was responsible for those subsequent attacks, and that the last missing girl, Souwa Kiseki, had been successfully turned by Suicide-Master's blood-sucking and was attacking her teammates in an act of revenge. That also explains why all the mummies had Suicide-Master's vampire genes.\nIf Kiseki is still at large and out for revenge, then other team members are still in danger. A pajama party currently being held at Higasa's house with Kanbaru and other former team members attending would be a prime target, so Araragi rushes off to make sure they're safe. The party attendees make him wear women's pajamas and do his hair in twintails. As he chats with them, he realizes he's in the wrong place—that based on how the culprit obtained information about the investigation, he ought to be back where he was before. The culprit wouldn't have known that Kanbaru was at Higasa's house—they would have assumed she was at her own home.\nMeanwhile, the culprit, a blond, golden-haired high school girl vampire, appears in Kanbaru's house. Evidently she was after Kanbaru, but instead she found Suicide-Master, who reproaches her for using her vampire powers for uncool purposes like revenge. Suicide-Master then makes her an offer. Having become so old and weak that she can't even regain her full form, Suicide-Master wishes to be killed before she ends up wanting to kill herself, like most vampires do. So, Suicide-Master gives the high school girl vampire the choice of sucking her blood and turning back into a human, or eating her whole and becoming a fully-fledged vampire. The high school girl vampire takes Suicide-Master up on the offer, but just before she goes in for the kill, Araragi shows up and stops her. He also reveals that she isn't Souwa Kiseki, but rather Kie Harimaze.\nIt turns out that Suicide-Master didn't actually attack Harimaze in the opening of the book—she just asked for directions. Harimaze begged Suicide-Master to turn her into a vampire, and Suicide-Master obliged. The vampirification was successful, but Harimaze's blood poisoned Suicide-Master, turning her into a mummy.\nBelieving Suicide-Master to be dead, Harimaze buried her near the shrine, took up her name, and went about attacking her teammates. Because personal identification of mummies is so difficult, especially when they all had similar hairstyles and bodies, she was able to make it seem like she was one of the victims. She was able to spy on the investigation using the cell phone she'd placed on one of the mummies, which eventually ran out of charge.\nAfter the reveal, Harimaze attacks Araragi. Before she gets to him, however, Kagenui appears and stops her. (Gaen had sent for Kagenui early on as a last resort in case they couldn't resolve the case without her brute force.) After a bit of a tussle, Suicide-Master convices her that neither Harimaze nor herself are strong enough to be worth her time.\nIn the end, Harimaze agrees to go back to being human in order to de-mummify her former teammates, and Suicide-Master leaves Japan with her wish to be killed unfulfilled. Finally, Araragi tells the whole story to Hitagi."},"#Introduced_Characters":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Illustrations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Trivia":{"link":["https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/360585675457822731/802343605707472916/temp.png?width=795&height=620"],"text":"Prior to release, the common English interpretation for the arc's name \"Shinobu Masutādo\" was Shinobu Mustard, before changing to Shinobu Mastered.

She is often seen having her left arm covered with bandages. Many people do not know that Kanbaru hides an oddity in the form of a \"sentient\" left arm.\nIt's revealed in Nisemonogatari by Deishuu Kaiki (and thought by Koyomi) that her mother's maiden name was Gaen. It's also revealed in Koimonogatari that her mother's name is Tooe Gaen. In Nekomonogatari White, it is also revealed that she used to be called Suruga Gaen.[1]\nShe is the narrator of Hanamonogatari, an arc in Orokamonogatari, and the titular protagonist of three main arcs: Suruga Monkey, Suruga Devil, and Suruga Bonehead, and four minor arcs: Suruga Court, Suruga Neat, Suruga Palace, and Suruga Speed.","#Appearance":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Naoetsu_Private_High_School"],"text":"Suruga is a girl with brown eyes and short dark bluish hair. Because of her club activities as a basketball varsity player, she boasts an athletic physique, although she admits that her breasts might not be ample enough for Araragi to notice.\nHer clothing style reflects her boyish personality. When she is not in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, she often wears sleeveless clothing and shorts. Whichever clothes she wear, she is regularly seen wearing cycling shorts, which she considers to be her underwear, much to Araragi's shock upon hearing it straight from her (as it implies that she does not wear panties)."},"#Personality":{"link":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujoshi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Rouka_Numachi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Rainy_Devil"],"text":"She considers herself a lesbian, fujoshi, and masochist.

According to Tsubasa, Suruga's character is somewhat unsettling, describing her as \"polite but inconsiderate\".[2] She is shown to be quite sloppy when it comes to keeping her room clean and organized, relying on Koyomi to help her clean it on a regular basis. Despite her commonly immature nature, she shows a level-headed personality during serious situations. \nWhen confronted by Rouka Numachi about the rumor of her being a lesbian, she confirms it, but claims she likes boys too.[3] Numachi suggests she's more into girls though, judging by the way she used to look at her teammates and opponents in basketball. Suruga denies ever looking at anyone in an unseemly way while playing, though realizes in her head that she isn't quite so sure herself.[4] In terms of boys, she hasn't shown much interest towards men around her other than a certain attraction towards Koyomi, often manifested in teasing or friendly flirting. Although she initially only tried to seduce him to divert his attention from Hitagi, they later became more friendly towards each other. In her conversation with Numachi, while she claims she hasn't thought much about what type of guy she'd like, she claims she likes them \"on the small side and kind.\" As him being short is referenced a lot more in the novels, one might presume it could refer to Koyomi. \nHidden to many is her tendency to be jealous of others to the point of subconsciously wanting to harm to them.

Unexpectedly, her competitors in one race she would participate in were attacked by an unknown assailant and were absent the next day. This would soon continue for some time, and this caused Suruga to be afraid, especially upon her discovery of the novel The Monkey's Paw, which tells the story of a similar item that grants wishes for a certain price.\nSuruga would soon shift her focus to basketball, where she immediately shone as the school's ace player, and this caused Hitagi Senjougahara, the track ace at that time, to take notice of her talent. She and Hitagi become close friends,with Kanbaru calling their pairing the Valhalla Combo (ヴァルハラコンビ Varuhara Konbi, formed by the \"varu\" from Kanbaru and \"hara\" from Senjougahara), and she soon forgot about the monkey's paw.\nImmediately after she entered senior high school, she became aware of Hitagi's secret and was threatened and attacked by her, just like Koyomi was.

Knowing only one person who could help her in returning to normal, Araragi takes her to Meme Oshino for advice.\nTo her surprise, Meme sees through her, exposing the truth about the attacks and the true identity of her unusual left arm, which turns out to be a devil's arm, not a monkey's. Moreover, Suruga turns out to be directly involved with the attacks and she was in fact harboring the killing intent that the Rainy Devil manifested, including what happened to Araragi the night before. According to Meme, the only thing left to do is either: (a) to let Koyomi be killed by the Rainy Devil, or (b) cut off Suruga's left arm.\nKanbaru is left to manifest the Rainy Devil inside Meme's place, and Araragi faces off with her alone. A one-sided battle between the two leaves Araragi badly mutilated by the Rainy Devil's attacks, and it required Meme's clever planning and Hitagi's direct intervention to quiet down the Rainy Devil. In the end, the Rainy Devil left Suruga's arm after the \"contract\" between Suruga and the Rainy Devil were broken by the fact that Araragi cannot be killed (one of Kanbaru's wishes), although her hand remained like it was.\nShe became friends with Koyomi and Hitagi after Koyomi rids her of the Rainy Devil.

Although the ceremony started smoothly, things spiral out of control when Koyomi discovers that there are two snake curses tormenting Nadeko. He attempts to confront the two curses by himself, but Suruga steps in to stop Araragi from putting himself in deeper trouble by battling the more powerful of the two snakes.

However, hidden by her achievements in school and her kind personality is a tense family life caused by unfortunate circumstances.\nShe was bewitched by an oddity on the first day of Golden Week, giving birth to her \"alternate self\" called Black Hanekawa, and for some time was responsible for a series of attacks on various people in town.\nShe and Black Hanekawa are the narrators of Nekomonogatari (White), and she is also the narrator of an arc in Wazamonogatari. She is the titular protagonist of four main arcs: Tsubasa Cat, Tsubasa Family, Tsubasa Tiger, and Tsubasa Sleeping, and of three minor arcs: Tsubasa Song, Tsubasa Board, and Tsubasa Lion.","#Appearance":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Suruga_Kanbaru","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Hitagi_Senjougahara","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi_Araragi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kizumonogatari","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Nekomonogatari","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Bakemonogatari","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsubasa_Cat","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsubasa_Tiger"],"text":"Tsubasa is a teenage girl with glasses, black hair, purple pupils, and a fair complexion. She is stated to be beautiful by Suruga Kanbaru, Hitagi Senjougahara, and Koyomi Araragi. She is almost always seen wearing her Naoetsu Private High School uniform, even outside of school days.\nChronologically early on in the series she wears glasses and her hair into braids. In Kizumonogatari, she has only one pony tail while in Nekomonogatari Black and Bakemonogatari, she ties them into two with a hair ribbon that has a cat design.\nAfter the events of Tsubasa Cat, she allows Koyomi to cut her hair as a symbol of her growth (Koyomi secretly keeps her braids). She also begins wearing contact lenses instead of her usual pair of glasses. After the events in Tsubasa Tiger, her hair has silvery-white stripes, resembling a tiger's, although she commonly dyes her hair back to its normal color each morning.\nAs shown during her moments as Black Hanekawa, Tsubasa has a slim figure and is well-endowed. Koyomi once commented in Tsubasa Family that Tsubasa's breasts are \"so appealing that one would want to cop a feel.\" Another interesting detail is her rather unique choice of underwear, which is often decorated with lace."},"#Personality":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Ougi_Oshino","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsubasa_Tiger"],"text":"To most people she interacts with, Tsubasa is a soft-spoken girl with a kind heart and a positive personality. Her top grades make her a favorite of the teachers, while her approachable character makes admirers out of her classmates. Tsubasa is also a wealth of information due to her study habits, but keeps humble about it, always stating that \"I don’t know everything, I just know what I know\" to those who commend her knowledge (although it should be noted that she only says this to Koyomi as this catchphrase makes Koyomi happy). She is never seen angry, but even when she does get mad, she retains her positive appearance, and often resorts to scolding the offender like a teacher, only to show a smile afterwards. The only instance where she is seen with a genuiely angry expression is during Sodachi Lost, when she confronts the trickster Ougi Oshino.\nHowever, those who are familiar with her true identity know that all of those are a facade that she shows to the public. The truth is that she often does things without the sentiment that comes along with it, and moves only through common sense. She also possesses a strong sense of righteousness that becomes a double-edged sword, to the point of interacting with her may cause oneself to notice one's imperfections.\nIn Tsubasa Tiger, her personality was described as \"accepting whatever comes her way without any objections\"[1] and \"shunning all of her undesirable traits somewhere else\"[2]. The latter was what caused the manifestation of Black Hanekawa and Kako, which symbolizes her stress and her envy and negative emotions, respectively.\nDespite this, Koyomi stated that Hanekawa is the individual he respects the most. She is his first and best friend as well as his \"savior\" during Kizumonogatari, causing him to deify her as his \"ideal girl.\""},"#Background":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi_Araragi"],"text":"Hanekawa currently lives with her stepfather and stepmother. Her biological mother was 17 years old when she got pregnant, while little is known from her biological father because she apparently had many lovers. Before she gave birth to Tsubasa, she married another man who was a \"workaholic\". Right after giving birth, Tsubasa's biological mother committed suicide. The workaholic stepfather, unable to raise a child, remarried again to a woman who is Tsubasa's current mother. The workaholic father soon died from overwork and the current mother married another man who is now Tsubasa's current father.\nIn the Hanekawa residence, Tsubasa doesn't have a room of her own, and usually sleeps in the hallway of the second floor. She also often cooks her own food, as do her parents, strongly suggesting distant ties of the Hanekawa family.\nBefore meeting Koyomi Araragi, despite her cheerful and positive persona as a responsible class president, her awkward situation with her parents made her long for an exciting change to happen."},"#Koyomi_Vamp":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kizumonogatari","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomi","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Vampire","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kiss-Shot_Acerola-Orion_Heart-Under-Blade","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Meme_Oshino"],"text":"Prior to her first meeting with Koyomi, Hanekawa heard rumors about a vampire coming to town. While she remained skeptical, the thought of meeting something as magnificent and other worldly as a vampire enticed her as it seemed like just the kind of life changing experience she desired.\nShe first meets Koyomi right after her second year of high school ends, and a gust of wind lifts her skirt, revealing her panties to him from the front. Through this awkward situation, their first conversation is struck. She had been paying attention to him before that, but this was the first time she ever got to talk to him directly. They talk about the fact that actually they know each other very well, despite never speaking to one another. Tsubasa notes that Koyomi doesn't seem to have any friends, to which he agrees and states he doesn't think he needs them. By the end of their conversation, she takes his phone and puts her number in it, teasingly stating he just accidentally made a friend. \nThe next time she meets him, he had turned into a vampire. Throughout the course of the story, she vigorously asserts herself to Koyomi (sometimes in rather flirtatious ways), making it very clear she wants to be friends and help him turn back into a human, even after he tries to reject her. She brings him clothes, gives advice, and even spectates his battles with the vampire hunters, causing her to get injured. Each time she was in danger, Koyomi was able to save her. In once instance however, he used his vampire blood (and in turn, the blood of Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade) to heal a fatal wound, causing the supernatural blood to rest dormant inside her despite staying human.\nNear the end of the story, she talks Koyomi out of suicide after he regrets everything he had done to revive a dangerous, man eating vampire. She also provides him with the information on exactly how he can become a human again: by killing his master. In the same scene, sexual tensions rise as she nearly allows Koyomi to touch her breasts, expecting to lose her virginity, before he changes his mind and settles for giving her a back massage instead.\nKoyomi's vampire story comes to a close and spring break ends. Koyomi and Hanekawa, now close friends, end up in the same class for their third year of high school.\nIt's later confirmed that she developed romantic feelings for Koyomi over the course of Koyomi Vamp as, after having a vampire like him save her, he was exactly the kind of person she was looking for to change her life. While she's commonly displayed as a flawless being through out the course of this arc in Araragi's perspective, Meme Oshino notes that there's something creepy and off about her flawlessness, suggesting it might lead to some issues later on."},"#Koyomi_Stone":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Koyomimonogatari"],"text":"On April 11th, Hanekawa expresses her curiosity about a shrine with a stone on a flowerbed at school.

She tells Araragi to go tell Oshino about it as thanks for his previous help.\nOshino tells Araragi to ask Hanekawa about Naetsu High's curriculum. She deducts that the shrine was a failed project by one of the handcraft students who decided to leave it at school rather than to take it home.

That night, Tsubasa would transform into a mischievous being that drains away the energy of others, which would be later named as Black Hanekawa, due to the influence of an oddity named the sawarineko.\nThroughout the next few days, Tsubasa would attack people at night as Black Hanekawa, draining away the energy of her victims. As the attacks increase in number, Meme and Koyomi are forced to confront her.

Following that short conversation, Tsubasa proceeds on her way to school, where she met a tiger-shaped oddity that is able to talk. The same day after that encounter, the Hanekawa Residence is consumed by fire and was completely destroyed.[5]\nWithout a home to live in, Tsubasa initially stayed over at the ruins of Eikou Cram School until Hitagi coerced her into staying over at her place for the meantime.[5] A few days later, she moves to the Araragi Residence after Hitagi's father made it inconvenient to have a visitor to stay over.[1] During Tsubasa's short stay in Koyomi's house, she was warmly welcomed by Koyomi's sisters Karen and Tsukihi, whom she had helped during summer break, but Koyomi's mother did point out that she cannot stay in their house for any longer.[6]\nIn a twist of fate, Tsubasa soon meets Episode, the half-vampire vampire hunter who almost took her life during spring break, although their ensuing conversation was more casual than expected. Soon, Episode meets his client, Izuko Gaen, and Tsubasa was lectured by Gaen about Tsubasa's ignorance. Izuko also reminds Tsubasa that the promblem with the tiger oddity, named by Izuko herself as \"Kako\", can only be solved by Tsubasa alone.\nTsubasa heeds Izuko's words and decides to seek more knowledge about Kako, but she realizes that she is actually dealing with a relatively new oddity. To make things worse, Hitagi's speculations indicate that Kako actually targets places from Tsubasa's past (過去, kako), more specifically the places Tsubasa called home. Tsubasa becomes afraid that with her house and the Eikou Cram School already burned down earlier, the Senjougahara and Araragi Residences are both at risk of burning down and killing her friends.[6]\nIn order to avoid this, Tsubasa decides to reconcile with her other side, Black Hanekawa, through a letter. Here, she also explains that she had also realized that both Black Hanekawa (as Tsubasa's stress) and Kako (as Tsubasa's envy and negative emotions) are part of her existence, and the only way to stop Kako is to absorb him before he could burn his next target, which turned out to be the Senjougahara Residence. Black Hanekawa manages to read Tsubasa's letter, but initially hesitated to help out. However, she took this chance to repay Hanekawa's kindness and decides to confront Kako alone.\nUnlike in previous manifestations of Black Hanekawa, Tsubasa was able to regain control of her body and used the opportunity to ask Kako to come back to her. However, Kako blatantly refuses and becomes aggressive, forcing Black Hanekawa to deal with him instead. Unfortunately, Kako's ability to envelop himself in flames made it impossible to defeat, so Black Hanekawa was able to delay his attack on the Senjougahara Residence by only ten seconds until she was rendered unable to fight.\nThen, out of nowhere, the Kokorowatari strikes down Kako before he could finish off Tsubasa, and Koyomi appears, acknowledging her short delay that allowed him to catch up.\nAfter Koyomi subdued Kako, Tsubasa finds out that Koyomi had read the letter she originally left for Black Hanekawa and decides to confess her love to Koyomi. Koyomi quickly turns her down, however. Tsubasa initially accepted the rejection well, but when she absorbs Kako, she breaks down into tears in front of him.\nIn the end, Hanekawa reabsorbs Kako back into her body and fully accepts Black Hanekawa as a part of her. This leads to half of Hanekawa's hair becoming white and forming a stripe-like pattern in her hair, which in turn causes her to dye her hair black every morning. The Hanekawa family also manages to move to a new home, where she finally gets a room for herself.[2]"},"#Ougi_Formula":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Owarimonogatari","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Sodachi_Oikura"],"text":"Tsubasa warns Koyomi to not enter his class, due to his bad relationship with Sodachi Oikura."},"#Sodachi_Riddle":{"link":[],"text":"Tsubasa tells Koyomi that Sodachi, who has been absent from school for so long has finally returned.

One morning, he fights with Tsukihi Araragi about who should take a bath first. In the end, they decide to take a bath together, and they wash each others' hair. Looking at the mirror in the bathroom, Koyomi finds that he can't see his reflection in the mirror, a phenomenon that only true vampires have. He talks to Shinobu Oshino about this problem, and she suggests asking the expert who specializes in immortal Oddities, Yozuru Kagenui and her familiar Yotsugi Ononoki. He uses his phone to mail Izuko Gaen asking for Kagenui's contact information. As he is preparing to write the mail, he receives a mail from Gaen, who says she has already made arrangements for Koyomi to meet Yotsugi tonight. Koyomi tells Karen Araragi and Tsukihi to sleep over at Suruga Kanbaru's place tonight, since he is worried that Kagenui will attempt to kill Tsukihi again.\nKoyomi and Shinobu go to an arcade later that night to meet Yotsugi and Kagenui. After Yotsugi examines Koyomi's body, Kagenui concludes that he is slowly turning into a vampire. What caused this condition was not because he had been giving Shinobu a small amount of his blood in order for her to live. It was rather because Koyomi has constantly been letting Shinobu suck a large amount of his blood to regain his vampire powers. For the past months, Koyomi has been repeatedly using this method in order to gain enough strength to fight various Oddities. This was especially the\ncase when Nadeko Sengoku turned into the snake god, and Koyomi had been fighting her at the shrine practically every day. Koyomi has relied so much on his vampire powers that he is turning into a vampire himself, independent of Shinobu. Currently, his condition is relatively light and the only obvious symptoms are lack of reflection and a relatively fast regeneration ability. Kagenui tells him that it's impossible to reverse the condition, but he can stop the condition from getting worse by never using his vampire powers again. Currently, Koyomi and Shinobu are recognized as harmless within Gaen's circle of Oddity experts. However, Kagenui warns him that if his condition worsens, then she will have no choice but to kill him.\nAs they are talking, Kagenui receives a call from Gaen. Gaen reports that Kanbaru and Koyomi's sisters have just been visited by a very dangerous Oddity expert, Tadatsuru Teori. Teori is\nalso an expert in immortal Oddities, which means Tsukihi is in danger. Yotsugi immediately takes Koyomi to Kanbaru's residence using her Unlimited Rulebook ability. When they arrive, they find that no one is in the house, and they find a single origami crane in the bedroom. As soon as Koyomi touches the paper crane, it multiplies into a thousand paper cranes. Realizing that Kanbaru and the others have been kidnapped by Teori, they go back to meet Kagenui, bringing the cranes as the only clue. Kagenui explains that Teori was a former member of Gaen's occult club in college along with Kagenui, Deishuu Kaiki, and Meme Oshino. Teori along with the others in the club created Yotsugi using a hundred-year-old corpse. A dispute occurred with who should have possession of\nYotsugi. Both Kaiki and Oshino backed down as they were not interested in her, but argument ensued between Teori and Kagenui. In the end Kagenui claimed possession of Yotsugi, and Teori left their circle. Stilling holding the grudge, Teori now works outside of Gaen's circle of Oddity experts. He is dangerous because of this, and Kagenui warns that he is very unpredictable. Teori's real target is Koyomi, not Tsukihi. He is using Kanbaru, Karen, and Tsukihi as hostages. Because Teori is outside of Gaen's circle of influence, the fact that Koyomi is recognized as harmless is meaningless to Teori. In Teori's eyes Koyomi is a vampire-hybrid that is also harboring Shinobu, and must be eliminated. Kagenui finds a message within one of the thousand cranes, and it indicates the Kita-Shirahebi Shrine. Kagenui has Yotsugi accompany Koyomi to the shrine, and\ntells them she will catch up later. Along the way, Yotsugi tells Koyomi that Kagenui actually wanted Teori to have possession of Yotsugi at first, but Yotsugi herself chose Kagenui in the end.\nWhen they reach the shrine, Koyomi has Yotsugi sneak up to the shrine from the other side to search for the hostages while he faces Teori in order to buy her some time. Koyomi sees Teori\nwaiting in front of the shrine. Teori tells Koyomi that someone sent him a request to eliminate Koyomi and Shinobu. Whoever sent him the request knew Teori is outside of Gaen's influence. However, he feels like he has been cast for a role in a movie because the timing seemed too perfect. It's like someone is directing everyone's actions. Teori claims that the only two people who are not being controlled or being \"cast\" right now are Kaiki and Oshino. Teori asks Koyomi to find Oshino, as he is the only hope for solving the recent abnormalities. Refusing to be cast as the character that fights Koyomi, Teori asks Yotsugi, who has been right behind him, to kill him. Yotsugi kills Teori with Unlimited Rulebook without any hesitation, obliterating him into dust. Koyomi is traumatized as he just witnessed a murder. Yotsugi tells him that the reason why she killed Teori is not because she was trying to protect him, but because she is a monster (\"bakemono\").\nAfterwards, they find Kanbaru and the others in the shrine. They are still asleep, and they don't seem to be harmed. Koyomi and Yotsugi send them back, still asleep, to Kanbaru's place, and Koyomi goes home. He is reminded about what Teori said about casting roles. He thinks that Teori perhaps was \"cast\" in order for him to witness the seemingly cute and innocent Yotsugi kill a man in cold blood. This way, Koyomi can never look at Yotsugi the same way again.\nThe next day is Valentine's Day, and Koyomi goes to Senjougahara's house, and Senjougahara makes him chocolate. He tells her about his current vampire condition. Senjougahara seems relatively calm about this news. She doesn't think it's too serious if the only obvious symptom is not being able to see his reflection. Koyomi and Senjougahara are still hopeful that they can have a normal life together. After Koyomi goes home, he is shocked to find Yotsugi pretending to be a doll in his sister's room. Yotsugi says if the purpose of last night's event was to create a distance between her and Koyomi, then Gaen and Kagenui suggests Yotsugi purposely work against this \"casting\" by staying close to him. As a result, Yotsugi will be staying at Koyomi's house until this town stabilizes."},"#Illustrations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Anime":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsukimonogatari_(anime)","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Hanamonogatari"],"text":"Tsukimonogatari was adapted into a four episode stand alone anime series similar to Hanamonogatari."}},{"id":"Tsukimonogatari (anime)","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsukimonogatari_(anime)","toc":["#Plot","#Episode_List",{"#Presentation":["#Screen_Flashes","#Arc_Specific_Screen_Flash_Styles","#Chapter_Numbers_In-between_Scenes","#Non-literal_/_Teleporting_Locations","#Alternate_Color_Palettes_/_Intense_Lighting_Effects","#VOFAN_Artwork_References"]},"#Music","#Trailers","#External_Links"],"Description":"Tsukimonogatari (憑物語) is the sixth Monogatari anime adaptation from studio Shaft.

To make things worse, Shinobu's mention of Deishuu Kaiki and Izuko Gaen slowly weakens Koyomi's resolve.\nIn the end, Koyomi falls back to contacting Yotsugi about his problem. Immediately, to Koyomi's surprise, Izuko Gaen sends a message to Koyomi, allowing him to meet Yotsugi.\nAfter talking to Shinobu, Koyomi is confronted by Tsukihi, who had to face Karen's wrath after what happened earlier. Koyomi takes the opportunity to take Karen and Tsukihi to Suruga's place, in order to prevent another contact between Tsukihi and the immortal oddity specialist Yozuru Kagenui. Then, later that night, Koyomi goes with Shinobu to the nearby arcade, where Koyomi had to fish out Yotsugi from a claw crane machine. Eventually, the unmoving Yotsugi Ononoki begins talking to Koyomi and Shinobu, and Yozuru soon arrives on cue, making a platform out of Shinobu's head.\nIn the ruins of Eikou Cram School, Yozuru examines Koyomi's little toe which was injured by Tsukihi early that morning and finds out that it has completely healed due to Koyomi's prolonged exposure to moonlight. After letting Yotsugi analyze Koyomi's status using the taste of his feet, Yozuru then gives a challenge to Koyomi by breaking his two fingers and telling him to use his powers to heal them back. Koyomi uses Tsubasa's breasts as a source of motivation and eventually manages to heal back his broken fingers. Yotsugi also finishes her analysis, but she wants Shinobu to say the final word about Koyomi's condition.\nShinobu emerges from Koyomi's shadow, her pride seemingly hurt from being stepped on by Yozuru, but she eventually recovers due to Koyomi's encouraging words. Soon, Yozuru and Yotsugi reveal that Koyomi is gradually becoming a vampire due to being transformed into a vampire too many times and relying too much on the powers of a vampire, especially during his many visits to the Kita-Shirahebi Shrine and being brought close to death on every visit.\nKoyomi calmly accepts the truth about his current condition and asks if there is something he can do to return to normal. Yotsugi bluntly states that there is currently no way he can become a human again."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Cultural_References":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Tsukimonogatari Episode 03: Yotsugi Doll, Part 3","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsukimonogatari_Episode_03:_Yotsugi_Doll,_Part_3","toc":["#Synopsis","#Characters","#Locations","#Music","#Trivia","#Quotes"],"Description":"","#Synopsis":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tadatsuru_Teori"],"text":"Koyomi accepts the grim truth that the hopes for him turning back to a human are slim. However, Yozuru reminds him that he hasn't lost all of his humanity yet, and there is still a way for his transformation to cease progress—that is, to stop relying on his vampire powers or be targeted as an immortal oddity. As sparks begin to fly between Yozuru and Shinobu, Yotsugi dispels the tension by asking Koyomi to promise to stop using his vampire powers.\nAs Yotsugi requested, Koyomi swears before his companions, although he himself is unsure if he could uphold it when a desperate situation happens, like when Hitagi or Tsubasa's life is put on the line.\nKoyomi decides to end their meeting there, but Yozuru insists that she and Yotsugi should examine his body more closely, with Yotsugi willingly taking up the role of examiner. As Yozuru takes the time to inform Izuko about the outcome of the meeting, Koyomi decides to ask Yozuru about why she kills immortal oddities. Yozuru explains that her occupation is a rarity among oddity specialists, and she warns Koyomi of one other oddity killer that she describes as \"gone astray\". Soon, Yozuru's conversation with Koyomi is interrupted by a phone call (presumably by Izuko Gaen), and she quickly tells Koyomi to bring Yotsugi to the Kanbaru Residence, although chances are that his younger sisters are no longer around the moment they arrivie there.\nJust as Yozuru foretold, the Kanbaru Residence is empty, and a small paper crane that expands into a banner of numerous colored ones is left as the sole piece of evidence. Upon returning to Eikou Cram School, Yozuru confirms that the perpetrator is a man named Tadatsuru Teori, a puppetmaster and immortal oddity specialist whose target is Tsukihi Araragi, and she tells Koyomi that neither he nor Shinobu can use their vampire powers this time. Koyomi slowly thinks that this set of coincidences happening at the same time is a kind of punishment for his incessant abuse of his vampire powers.\nAs Shinobu and Yotsugi play outside, Yozuru explains more about Tadatsuru Teori. According to her, Tadatsuru has an obsession over oddities and their aesthetics, and assures Koyomi that Suruga, Tsukihi and Karen are safe, and she is willing to help in saving them since Izuko asks her to. However, as an immortal oddity specialist, the only help she can provide is information. Yozuru thinks that the paper cranes left by Tadatsuru is a clue as well as a sign that Tadatsuru is also interested about him and Shinobu.\nKoyomi eventually discovers a note among the folded paper cranes, pointing to Kita-Shirahebi Shrine. Despite being unable to rely on his vampire powers to survive a jump by Yotsugi, Koyomi braves another quick trip care of Yotsugi."},"#Characters":{"link":[],"text":"By order of appearance"},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Trivia":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Tsukimonogatari Episode 04: Yotsugi Doll, Part 4","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsukimonogatari_Episode_04:_Yotsugi_Doll,_Part_4","toc":["#Synopsis",{"#Characters":["#New_Characters"]},"#Locations","#Music","#Trivia","#Quotes"],"Description":"","#Synopsis":{"link":[],"text":"Koyomi and Yotsugi land near a bridge, where Ougi Oshino is. After she refuses a one-jump hitchhike from Koyomi, Ougi notices that he is not with Shinobu like always, although he is still relying on the powers of other people. Koyomi soon decides to part ways with Ougi, when she notices that Koyomi has been calmer and more mature than before when faced with the possibility of losing his humanity. Koyomi continues walking away, stating that all that matters now is that he has to succeed.\nYotsugi and Koyomi continue their journey to Kita-Shirahebi Shrine. Here, Yotsugi offers her own information about Tadatsuru Teori, which she insists Koyomi to listen to. According to her, Tadatsuru, unlike Yozuru who deals with still-living immortal oddities, handles immortal oddities considered dead. However, their incompatibility stems from back in their college days, when Meme Oshino, Deishuu Kaiki, Yozuru Kagenui, Izuko Gaen and Tadatsuru Teori reanimated a corpse as a harmless summer project, and Tadatsuru and Yozuru fought over who will own the corpse that would later be known as Yotsugi Ononoki. In the end, Yotsugi chose Yozuru, and it sparked the discord between Yozuru and Tadatsuru.\nAfter retelling her own origins to Koyomi, she tells him that she is willing to act as a bargaining chip if ever Koyomi is unable to save Suruga and his siblings in time. However, Koyomi rejects that idea and repays it by flipping Yotsugi's skirt. Instead, Koyomi plans to act as a decoy while Yotsugi finds a chance to rescue the three girls before making a quick escape using Unlimited Rulebook; meanwhile, Koyomi has to deal with Tadatsuru by performing a dogeza in front of him. Yotsugi questions the usefulness of Koyomi's dogeza in front of an immortal oddity specialist, and soon, she begins doubting if Koyomi has matured at all for devising such a plan. Still, her alternate plan is outright killing Tadatsuru in a surprise attack, and Koyomi brings them back to the drawing board.\nThe two soon reach the main complex of Kita-Shirahebi Shrine, where Tadatsuru Teori is filling the shrine's offering box with rapidly folded pieces of paper. Koyomi assumes that the offering box is now a makeshift timer that would end as soon as Tadatsuru fills it with origami. Without a way to determine how much time is left, Yotsugi settles with Koyomi's decoy plan. As Yotsugi begins searching for Tsukihi, Karen and Suruga, Shinobu emerges from Koyomi's shadow to remind Koyomi to be safe, and she will bite him and turn him into a vampire the moment he loses his advantage.\nKoyomi eventually steps in front of Tadatsuru Teori, and he immediately makes a connection between him and Yozuru Kagenui. Tadatsuru then reveals that he and Yozuru share a similar curse that prevents them from stepping on the ground as a lesson on \"knowing one's place\". Soon, Tadatsuru reveals that his main objective is to eliminate Koyomi, and Koyomi takes the chance to ask him to release the three girls.\nTadatsuru refuses. However, he soon begins to wonder about the reason why he is in Kita-Shirahebi Shrine, as well as his reason to exterminate Koyomi. Tadatsuru suspects that he was merely given a role to fill in, and he thinks that Yozuru, Yotsugi, and even Koyomi were put in a similar position. Soon, the topic shifts to Meme Oshino and his whereabouts, and not even Tadatsuru knows where he is right now.\nSoon, Tadatsuru finishes the last origami pieces and stands determined over the offering box. He refuses to confront Koyomi and instead urges him to look for Meme.\nThen, Tadatsuru turns away from Koyomi for his final request, something that a human like Koyomi wouldn't be able to fulfill. Inside the main temple, Yotsugi emerges and uses Unlimited Rulebook in its strongest to swiftly kill Tadatsuru.\nKoyomi is left stunned by Yotsugi's decision, but she points out that she chose to kill Tadatsuru despite having options to leave him unscathed because she is a monster. Thus, she warns Koyomi to not become someone like her.\nKoyomi and Yotsugi soon find Suruga, Tsukihi and Karen sleeping inside the offering box. Yozuru also manages to meet up with Koyomi and Yotsugi, although she tells the two that she cannot handle tasks that need to exert power to be accomplished. By daybreak, Koyomi and Yotsugi return the three girls to their futons in the Kanbaru Residence, and Yotsugi finally parts ways with Koyomi, just as he discovers that he reclaims a body that is more resilient to sunlight.\nThe experience where he sees Yotsugi murders someone as a monster remains in his head for some time. He thinks that it serves as a reminder of how he and Yotsugi stand as a human and a tsukumogami, as well as a reminder of the mistakes he committed in the past, notably related to Nadeko Sengoku and Mayoi Hachikuji.\nOn his visit to Tamikura-sou, Hitagi Senjougahara surprises Koyomi by giving him chocolates, and this reminds him of Valentine's Day. Soon, Koyomi tells Hitagi about what happened and Hitagi does not seem worried, although she deems it necessary to ask other specialists about what to do. As Koyomi begins to ramble about his life, about Tadatsuru and about Tsubasa Hanekawa, Hitagi pins down Koyomi and tells him to postpone his plans for until tomorrow.\nKoyomi eventually returns to check up on his sisters. Aside from seeing them in the middle of changing clothes, he sees Yotsugi on Tsukihi's bed, much to his shock. Yotsugi, who ends up with the Fire Sisters as a prize in a claw crane game, soon reveals that she is advised to watch over him by Izuko and Yozuru while the town remains unstable. For the meantime, Koyomi finds himself with one more young girl to deal with at home."},"#New_Characters":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Locations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Music":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Trivia":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Quotes":{"link":[],"text":""}},{"id":"Tsunade","url":"https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Tsunade","toc":["#Background",{"#Plot":["#Mayoi_Snail"]}],"Description":"Tsunade (綱手) was the surname of the mother of Mayoi Hachikuji.

Sucking blood also seems to empower them, reinforcing their various powers.\nVampires are also known for consuming not only human flesh, but nearly anything at all, including other oddities. If a vampire does not wish to make a minion out of their victim, they will eat them whole before their vampirism awakens. Eating oddities is a proficient way to get rid of them.\nLike all oddities, vampires thrive on the fear humanity has for them. Legends of vampires originated in the western world, which eventually became real when enough people learned of them. Vampires had no known presence in Japan prior to the first appearance of Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade about 400 years before the series takes place. While not of Japanese origin, due to their description and literal translation as blood sucking demons, they are sometimes associated with the Japanese demon: oni (鬼).","#Appearance":{"link":[],"text":"Appearances vary between many vampires, so much so that telling them apart from humans can be difficult if their unique features aren't easily visible.

He realizes that he's currently neither a high schooler nor a college student. It's like he became a nobody, and he thinks he is in some kind of limbo at the moment. While contemplating about these things, he goes to the bathroom to wash his face. He looks into the mirror, and notices that his reflection is staring at him, despite the fact that he lowered his face. He then tries to touch the mirror, and his hand goes right through the mirror. The entire mirror turns purple, and Araragi blacks out. When he wakes up, he is still in the bathroom. Karen Araragi is taking a bath, and he realizes that she is a lot shorter than she used to be. She used to be taller than him, but now she is shorter. Confused, he leaves the bathroom, and goes to his sisters' room to talk to Tsukihi Araragi. There aren't any noticeable changes with Tsukihi, and she doesn't seem to notice Karen's drastic change in height. Tsukihi leaves her room to take a bath, and Yotsugi Ononoki, (who was pretending to be a doll), starts talking to him. Araragi notices right away that Ononoki actually has facial expressions. Her facial expression ticked him off, so he leaves the house in order to avoid getting into an argument with her. Thinking that something is definitely off. He calls Shinobu Oshino, but she doesn't respond.\nHe goes to Kitashirahebi Shrine to discuss this strange matter with the newly appointed god, Mayoi Hachikuji. On the way, he has trouble finding his way to the shrine. At the shrine, Araragi is once again surprised by what he sees. Hachikuji Mayoi is in the form of an adult, or what she would have looked like if she didn't die from the car accident. Araragi was able to recognize her because he saw Hachikuji in this form during the events of Mayoi Jianshi. Araragi tells her about the strange occurrences, and Hachikuji deduces that Araragi has somehow entered the mirror world. This explains why all the words he saw in this world were mirror images. The entire city is also mirrored with right and left flipped over which also explains why he constantly made wrong turns on the way to the shrine. Hachikuji guesses that the reason why Araragi can't call Shinobu is because vampires don't have reflections, and therefore doesn't exist in the mirror world. She also explains that the same type of logic that works in his world may not work in the mirror world. For example, if Hachikuji is in her adult form, that would suggest she didn't die from the car accident. If she didn't die, she would not have turned into a ghost, and she would not have met Araragi and become a god in the end. Yet the Hachikuji in this world knows Araragi. Hachikuji suggests that Shinobu may be able to open a gate from the \"real world\" allowing Araragi to return. Araragi remembers that the bathtub in Suruga Kanbaru's house has magical properties. In the bathtub it's supposedly possible to see one's future partner from the reflection on the water. Araragi hopes that he will be able to communicate with Shinobu on the other side.\nAraragi arrives at Kanbaru's place. Just when he is about to ring the bell, Kanbaru attacks him in her Rainy Devil form. Araragi tries to run away, but Kanbaru is too fast. Araragi is about to get killed when he is saved by Black Hanekawa, who takes him to the Shirohebi Park. It seems as if someone has sent Black Hanekawa to help him. She advises Araragi to stay away from Kanbaru's house, and urges him to find a \"partner\". Araragi goes back home hoping to talk to Ononoki about the situation, and he is greeted by Sodachi Oikura. In this world, Oikura has lived in Araragi's house since elementary school. Having never experienced the traumatic events described in Ougi Formula, Sodachi Riddle, and Sodachi Lost, she is very cheerful, and seems to have a sibling-like relationship with Araragi. They spend some time solving math puzzles together. Oikura says she has a really happy life right now, but somehow, she thinks that it's all a lie. In the end, Araragi is not able to find Ononoki in the house. Seeing if Hachikuji has found any new information, Araragi goes to the shrine again.\nAt the shrine, Araragi finds that Hachikuji has brought Nadeko Sengoku with her. Sengoku in this world has short white hair, and talks exactly like the snake god Kuchinawa in Nadeko Medusa. Araragi is still confused about the nature of this world. He originally thought everything is mirrored, but Kanbaru's Monkey Paw is on her left arm in this world, which is not mirrored. Sengoku explains that the things in this world is not mirrored, but inverted, as if looking at words from the back side of the paper. In this world, everyone's underlying personalities and desires are manifested on the outside. Karen doesn't like the fact that she's so tall. Ononoki wants to be able to show emotions. Hachikuji wishes that she can grow up. Kanbaru and Hanekawa have alter egos that they are trying to suppress. Sengoku wants to be more assertive. Tsukihi is unchanged because she has absolutely no hidden desires. She is what she is, and she's perfectly happy with who she is. Araragi wonders about where the Araragi in the mirror world is, seeing as how everyone he knows has a counterpart in this world. He suspects that he switched places with the \"mirror Araragi\". This worries him, because he believes his counterpart in the mirror world must be Ougi Oshino, and if that's the case, she could be causing trouble in the \"real world\".\nThat night he returns home and goes to bed. Araragi's room has a bunk bed, and Oikura sleeps on top. He asks Oikura about mirrors, and she points out that a mirror can only reflect 80% of the light, a reflection is always blurred compared to the original. Araragi goes to sleep, but he is woken up by Ononoki. Ononoki offers to take him to see Shinobu in this world. Ononoki has returned to her expressionless self. She has noticed that Araragi reacted strangely to Ononoki in the morning, so she readjusted her personality to better match Araragi's fomer impression of her. They arrive at the location of the abandoned cram school building. However, the building has been replaced by an Eastern-style castle. Inside the castle, he meets Oshino Shinobu (Kissshot Acerolaorion Heartunderblade), in her human form, hidden behind a curtain. Araragi remember that this is how Shinobu can exist without contradicting Hachikuji's statement that vampires don't exist in this world. Shinobu advises Araragi to leave this world as soon as possible. If he stays any longer, he can have adverse effects on the people of this world. For example, he has already influenced Ononoki in this world to change her personality. He is also causing Oikura to suspect the happy life she's living is a lie. It will devastate her if she finds out about the actual Oikura that Araragi remembers. Because this world is full of paradoxes, Araragi can easily break the balance of this world by making others realize those paradoxes. Shinobu apologizes for not being able to help him return to his world, but she believes he is on the right track for going to Kanbaru's bathtub. During the conversation with Shinobu, Araragi feels extremely guilty for causing her trouble, and wants to take his own life to make up for his insolence. He doesn't quite know why he feels so suicidal in front of her, but this feeling becomes stronger as time progresses. Finally, Ononoki concludes that they have run out of time. She bids Shinobu farewell, and leaves the castle with Araragi using Unlimited Rulebook. Ononoki explains that humans can't be near Shinobu for too long. Otherwise they will want to commit suicide for Shinobu. If she doesn't hide behind a curtain, Araragi would have taken his own life immediately from her immense beauty. This is the tragic nature of the human Shinobu as described in the story Utsukushi Hime (Princess Beauty). In order to get into Kanbaru's house, Araragi decides to have Ononoki help him.\nThe next day, Araragi and Ononoki heads for Kanbaru's house. As soon as Rainy Devil comes out, Ononoki acts as a distraction to buy time, while Araragi successfully enters the house and find the bathtub without harm. Nothing happens by looking at the reflection in the water, even after he takes off his clothes to take a bath. Suddenly, someone enters the bathroom. Araragi doesn't recognize the person, but the person introduces herself as Tooe Gaen, Kanbaru's mother. Tooe joins Araragi in the bathtub. She seems to completely understand Araragi's situation just by looking at him. Tooe claims that the bathtub doesn't hold any magical properties. Araragi explains his current situation. Tooe says she cannot give him any advice, but she can help him scrub his back. While scrubbing his back, Tooe explains why she gave her daughter the Monkey's Paw. Tooe reveals that the Gaen family specializes in creating Oddities. She is not quite sure why her sister Izuko Gaen decided to choose the path of eliminating Oddities instead. She states that in a way, Gaen Izuko has also created an Oddity by making Ononoki. Rainy Devil was Tooe's alter ego, and in order to eliminate it, she had to face herself. She believes that a day will come when Kanbaru will have to face herself as well. Tooe gave Kanbaru a part of Rainy Devil in order to tell her daughter to not become like her. She thinks the way she dealt with her alter ego reveals how weak she actually is. Tooe respects Araragi for choosing to save his alter ego, Oshino Ougi, from destruction. Tooe also tells Araragi to find his partner. Araragi looks at the mirror in the bathroom, and realizes that Tooe doesn't have a reflection. This can be explained by the fact that she doesn't exist in the \"real world\". After Tooe finishes scrubbing his back, she asks him to help Kanbaru when the time comes, and disappears. Araragi's back hurts from Tooe scrubbing so hard, and he looks at his back using the mirror. He realizes Tooe has written the words \"Naoetsu High School\" on his back.\nAraragi meets up with Ononoki, who is still fighting with Kanbaru, and they escape using Unlimited Rulebook. Araragi explains what happened, and they decide to split up. Araragi will go to the high school, and Ononoki will look for Black Hanekawa in order to figure out who sent Hanekawa to save Araragi from Kanbaru. In order to avoid suspicion in the high school, Araragi returns home in order to change into his school uniform first. However, he can't find his uniform in his closet, and instead finds a girl's uniform. He realizes that it must belong to Ougi. This supports his theory about the \"mirror Araragi\" being Ougi. Shinobu has told him that he can adverse effects on this world. Now, Araragi thinks about the possibility that this world could be having adverse effects on him instead. He believes that having Ougi's uniform means he is slowly turning into Ougi. The thought of Araragi turning into someone other than himself terrifies him, further driving him to resolve everything as soon as possible. Reluctantly, Araragi decides to wear the girl's uniform to school. Meanwhile, Ononoki goes to the shrine in order to ask about where Black Hanekawa is. To her surprise, she finds Hachikuji, Sengoku, and a six-year-old Hanekawa drinking sake together. Sengoku explains that it has all been a misunderstanding. All they have to do now is to wait for Araragi to realize the misunderstanding and find his partner, and the problem will be solved.\nBack at Naoetsu High School, Araragi goes to his third year classroom, but he doesn't find anything. Then, realizing where he is supposed to go, he goes to the hidden classroom that Ougi created during the events of Ougi Formula, and finds Ougi waiting for him. At this point, it is revealed that Ougi is the \"partner\" that the other people were referring to throughout the story. Ougi is dressed up in a boy's school uniform (reference to Suruga Devil). Ougi switched the uniform in Araragi's closet as a joke so that he can hurry up and find her. She didn't expect him to actually wear it. Ougi explains that this isn't the mirror world. Araragi did not enter the mirror world. Instead, he has brought the things in the mirror world into the real world. Ougi reminds him that a typical mirror only reflects 80% of the light, which means 20% is absorbed into the mirror. Araragi has unintentionally brought out the absorbed 20% into his world. That 20% contains everyone's regret and the things everyone left behind. For example, Hanekawa is still in town even though she left the country because she secretly still wants to stay with her friends. This explains why Araragi can never find a version of himself in this world, because he has never left his world to begin with. During the process, Ougi became trapped in the hidden classroom so she couldn't get out and help Araragi. This entire event started when Araragi was reluctant to let go of his high school self the day after graduation. He still had regrets, and he didn't want to leave everything behind to start a new life. He wanted to bring back the things he had left behind, but in the process he has brought the things everyone else's regrets along. Ougi asks Araragi to be more careful next time. As the master of the former Heartunderblade, the most powerful Oddity, and the creator of Ougi, Araragi actually has considerable supernatural powers. In order to change this world back to normal, Ougi gives him a black mirror. She explains a black mirror absorbs 100% of the light. By bringing this mirror to the Kitashirahebi Shrine, the 20% that was brought out by Araragi can be absorbed back in. Ougi tells him to replace the mirror once it turns white.\nAfter the resolution, Araragi meets Hitagi Senjougahara. During this event Araragi didn't see Hitagi because he didn't want to peek into Hitagi's inner self. He also has no regrets for Hitagi since he's willing to spend his future with her. He tells Hitagi about what happened. While they are waiting for the traffic light, Araragi says that sometimes, he thinks about which foot to step forward with once the light turns green. The more he thinks about it, the more reluctant he gets, and it becomes almost impossible to decide. People often think too much, and end up not being able to move forward at all. This reflects how he doesn't know how to move forward after graduating high school. Hitagi laughs, and tells him that if he doesn't know which foot to step forward with, there is an easy way to solve that problem. The light turns green, and Hitagi hops forward with both her feet, and Araragi hurriedly follows suit."},"#Illustrations":{"link":[],"text":""},"#Anime":{"link":["https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Zoku_Owarimonogatari_(anime)","https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Shaft"],"text":"An anime adaptation by studio Shaft was released in Japanese theaters on November 10, 2018.
