  "Description": "Suruga's Father (surname Kanbaru) was the husband of Tooe Gaen, the brother-in-law of Izuko Gaen, and the father of Suruga Kanbaru. It was later revealed that Suruga's parents eloped at some point during Suruga's elementary school life, as the Kanbaru family did not approve of their relationship."
