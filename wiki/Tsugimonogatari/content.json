  "Description": "Tsugimonogatari (接物語) is the 24th part of the Monogatari series. It is the thirtieth book overall. \nIt was originally the supposed novel previewed at the end of Zoku Owarimonogatari to take place in a season supposedly called Monogatari: Next Season. Since then, it had been largely assumed that both titles have received a name change as Orokamonogatari in Monogatari: Off Season.[1] The preview in the back of Orokamonogatari shows Wazamonogatari and Off Season along with a list of the series but shows nothing about a Tsugimonogatari or Next Season.[2] With the release of Ikusamonogatari in 2023, Tsugimonogatari was re-announced as the second novel in the Family Season.",
