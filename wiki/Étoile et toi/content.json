  "Description": "étoile et toi is the closing theme song of the Kizumonogatari film trilogy. There are two vocalized versions of the song, the original debuted in the credits of Part 2: Nekketsu while an édition le blanc (white edition) was used in Part 3: Reiketsu. The vocalized version was not used in the first film, but the song is quoted through out the entire trilogy's soundtrack.\nEach of the two versions is available in the soundtracks for the second and third films.",

    "text": "The song acts as a main theme for the entire film series, being quoted in at least 17 different tracks through out the trilogy.\nThe translated lyrics bare a striking similarity to those of the Shinobu Mail theme: Mein schatz. The lyrics for each song were written by meg rock around the same time, suggesting this could have been done on purpose."
