  "Description": "In the Monogatari series, a season generally refers to a grouping of Monogatari installments (often correlated in anime adaptations' cours) throughout the franchise. Unlike other TV series, seasons in Monogatari are often used in reference to the original novel release's groupings, not by collections of TV series episodes. \nSeasons generally contain stories which take place within a certain time span, and Seasons themselves generally chronologically proceed each other, but the arcs within them are often scrambled out of chronological order from each other to provide a unique experience. \nOff Season in particular, while having many stories that take place after Final Season, also contains some stories that occur throughout the timeline.",
