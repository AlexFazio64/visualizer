Before she gave birth to Tsubasa, she married another man who was a \"workaholic\". Right after giving birth, Tsubasa's biological mother committed suicide. The workaholic stepfather, unable to raise a child, remarried again to a woman who is Tsubasa's current mother. The workaholic father soon died from overwork and the current mother married another man who is now Tsubasa's current father."
