    "text": "Nozomi's grandparents fixed her soul into a clay golem after she died as a child, causing her to become an immortal girl. Her outer appearance stopped aging in middle school, though she was able to attend Naoetsu Private High School as a high schooler. Contrasting Zenka, who often avoids water to prevent her from turning into her aquatic form, Nozomi needs to regularly supply herself with water to prevent herself of drying out, as her body was made of mud. To prevent this, she keeps a small flask with her to regularly drink water."
