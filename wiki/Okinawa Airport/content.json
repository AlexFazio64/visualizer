    "link": [],
    "text": "During the Hitagi End arc, Kaiki receives a phone call from Senjougahara posing a job-offer concerning conning someone, who is left ambiguous. Kaiki flies to Okinawa after flat-out lying to Senjougahara, telling her that he currently resided there and reusing his alias \"Suzuki\", in which Senjougahara applies \"Senshougahara\" to herself in return. Both meet at a caf√© in the airport and discuss specifics regarding the job-offer in poorly-crafted disguises, Kaiki in a Hawaiian shirt and sunglasses, while Senjougahara in a pair of Groucho glasses. They fly back to Naoetsu town after their rendezvous."
