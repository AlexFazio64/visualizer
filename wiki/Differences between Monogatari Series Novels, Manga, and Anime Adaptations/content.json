  "Description": "While the adaptations of the Monogatari Series light novels generally stay relatively true to their source material, like all adaptations, there is cut content and a handful of notable changes.\nIn general, the novels feature extended conversations and hefty narration commentary, while the adaptations have shortened dialogue and unique visuals. Occasionally, text flashes are put in place for narration and other text from the novels that is otherwise left out in the anime adaptation. Major plot points are mostly unchanged, though some story content is occasionally cut or altered slightly.\nThe novels are also notably more meta, especially featuring even more references to other anime, manga, and light novels and a self aware attitude in which the fourth wall is constantly broken. The novels even reference the anime adaptations, noting how certain parts may be hard to animate and mentioning voice actors of characters. The novels also have certain instances that refer to darker, more serious subject matter that are sometimes cut from adaptations.\nWith the exception of certain oddity characters like Seishirou, Kako and Kuchinawa who appear somewhat predominantly on some novel covers, no male characters, including protagonist Koyomi Araragi, are depicted in novel artwork, meaning their appearances are more open to the imagination in novel canon. As such, visual gags such as Koyomi's expressive ahoge are only present in the animated version.\nNotably, the manga adaptation came later, and therefore adapts elements from both the novels and animated versions while featuring a distinct canon that takes a few more liberties in altering the story.\nAs this page is a work in progress, many notable differences may still be missing.",

These show scenes like Kiss-Shot being found under a light in what looks like an underground tunnel and earlier character designs for the hunters, especially Dramaturgy who looks more inhumanly with dark skin and red eyes."

    "link": [],
    "text": "Being a film, as opposed to a TV adaptation, Kizumonogatari seems to take the most liberties in terms of cutting and changing material from the source material compared to other anime adaptations. Combined with wanting to make it more cinematic and not having enough run-time, quite a bit of material was cut or altered slightly. It also notably depicts certain events differently from even the TV series adaptations."
