    "text": "The song is an instrumental orchestral rock piece that features a male chorus, as well as slow and quick parts while changing time signatures from 3/4 to 4/4.\nThe song is not used in the TV broadcast of Monogatari Series Second Season, and was first released in the Blu-ray and DVD release of the series along with the opening sequence for the Shinobu Time arc. The opening sequence features depictions of the main characters of the story arc by Hajime Ueda.\nUnlike all the other opening theme songs used in the adaptation of the Monogatari series, the song does not feature the character whose name is used for the corresponding arc. According to an interview, Maaya Sakamoto, the voice actress of Shinobu Oshino in the anime adaptations of the Monogatari series, chose to write and perform songs under her own name and thus refuses to perform character songs.[1]"
