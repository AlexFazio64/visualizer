  "Description": "This is a list of every piece of music that is used in the anime adaptation of the Monogatari Series. The timestamps are based on the BD release with the exception of  Owarimonogatari (Part 2).\nTracks are referred to by their romanized Japanese title but since there are different romanization systems the title can be slightly different in other places. Removing apostrophes and spaces as well as only searching for part of the title can make it easier to find a track. It can also be helpful to search for the OST album and look through the track listing. A lot of the soundtracks also have been released multiple times. vgmdb.net is a good resource to find the different releases and it often includes kanji and translated titles.",
