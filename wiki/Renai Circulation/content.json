    "text": "Renai Circulation remains the most popular opening in the series, gaining notoriety for it's many covers, parodies, and remixes over the internet.\nThe opening was directed by Shin Oonuma.\nThe ちりもつもればやまとなでしこ？ 「し」抜きで　いや　死ぬ気で！ line is a pun. A 'Yamato Nadeshiko' is equivalent to the ideal woman in Japanese (elegant but not a pushover), and Nadeko Sengoku's first name is a 'shi' away from the word 'Nadeshiko'. '[Shi] nuki de' means 'without the 'shi', but it's written as the term for 'going all out expecting to die'."
