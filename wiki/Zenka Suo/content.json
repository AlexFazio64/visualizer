    "text": "As a teen, Zenka once ate mermaid flesh while dying, turning her into an immortal half mermaid and saving her life. Touching water causes her scales to sprout, turning her into a partial fish. The transformation is actually different every time, having the potential to be possibly any aquatic creature. The transformation is also not limited to fish exclusively, although it seems aquatic mammals are off limits. Unlike one would presume, her upper half is often where most of the changes take place.  \nTurning into a half-mermaid gave her immortality. preventing her from killing herself despite attempting multiple times due to hating her aquatic form. At her current age, she's grown to accept her place and use her powers to become bait for oddities, as mermaid flesh is said to be delicious."
