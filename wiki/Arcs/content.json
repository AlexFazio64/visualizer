  "Description": "In the Monogatari series, an arc (or more officially referred to as an episode in the novels) is a set story deprived of its own chapters. Different novels/anime cours contain a different number of arcs, some only being made up of a single arc. The common theme is that the first word in the arc name is the name of a character, while the second is a noun or verb. The unique most element of an arc's name is the second word. Some anime adaptions often display the arc's name in the opening title sequence and or in screen flashes.\nArcs are contained inside Monogatari installments (often correlated with the anime series's cours), which are contained inside Seasons. Each arc has its own \"number\" corresponding to it, although for some arcs, particularly those of the Second Season, the number is instead replaced by another kanji, with a meaning related to the contents of the arc.\nThe following is a list of the various main story arcs in novel release order.",
