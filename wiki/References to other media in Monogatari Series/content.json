  "Description": "With the witty, meta prose Nisio Isin is known for, the Monogatari Series is full of references and tributes to other anime, films, manga, video games, and internet memes alike. This page is meant to highlight as many as possible found in the light novel and TV series in detail in one place.\nSince certain references are featured in both the light novel series and anime, light novel references will be exclusive to ones that were left out of the adaptation. Note that there's a lot of references, so this page is nowhere near complete.\nReferences can also be found in the Cultural References section of most episode pages.\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 References in the Light Novels\n\n1.1 References to other Anime/Manga\n\n1.1.1 Death Note\n1.1.2 Dragon Ball Z\n\n\n1.2 References to Video Games\n\n1.2.1 Dragon Quest\n\n\n\n\n2 References in the TV series\n\n2.1 References to other Anime/Manga\n\n2.1.1 Ashita no Joe\n2.1.2 Black Jack\n2.1.3 Fullmetal Alchemist\n2.1.4 Medaka Box\n2.1.5 Neon Genesis Evangelion\n2.1.6 Sailor Moon\n2.1.7 Higurashi When They Cry\n\n\n2.2 References to Japanese Literature\n\n2.2.1 No Longer Human by Osamu Dazai\n\n\n2.3 References to Western Film\n\n2.3.1 2001: A Space Odyssey\n2.3.2 James Bond\n2.3.3 The Shawshank Redemption\n2.3.4 A Clockwork Orange\n\n\n2.4 References to Western Animation\n\n2.4.1 Peanuts\n2.4.2 The Powerpuff Girls\n\n\n2.5 References to Video Games\n\n2.5.1 Resident Evil\n\n\n2.6 References to Internet Memes\n\n2.6.1 Reaction Guys / Gaijin 4koma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences in the Light Novels[]\n\n\n\nReferences to other Anime/Manga[]\n\nDeath Note[]\nIn the English publication of Kizumonogatari, upon first meeting Hanekawa after seeing her underwear, she not only calls Araragi by his full name, but also explains the exact characters to write it. This surprises him, to which he responds in narration:\n\"Seriously? She knew my name and face. If she had a Death Note, I'd be dead...\" (Isin 24).\nIn the Death Note series, a death note is a notebook that causes anyone's name written in it to die, so long as the writer knows their name and face. Interestingly, Monogatari author Nisio Isin has also written a spin off Death Note novel known as Death Note Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases.\n\nDragon Ball Z[]\nIn the English publication of Kizumonogatari, when explaining how Kiss-shot changes forms to Hanekawa, Araragi states:\n\"Well, to put it Lord Frieza Style, she has two more transformations left, one for her right leg, and one for both her arms.\" (Isin 153).\nIn Dragon Ball Z, Lord Frieza is a villain who transforms multiple times in the series. He's infamous for having at least 6 different forms, each more powerful than the last.\nIn the second part of the Owarimonogatari anime, Koyomi imitates Yamcha's death.\n\nReferences to Video Games[]\nDragon Quest[]\nIn the light novel version of Hitagi Crab, on page 76, Senjougahara jokingly threatens to spread a rumor about Araragi involving him attempting to equip the slave armor on Nera Briscoletti, a party member in Dragon Quest V.\n\nReferences in the TV series[]\n\n\n\nReferences to other Anime/Manga[]\n\nAshita no Joe[]\nIn the second cour of Owarimonogatari during Hitagi Rendezvous, when Araragi is talking to Tsukihi about how violent he was in the past, he assumes Jou Yabuki's form.\n\n \t \t \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t \n \t \t \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t Astro Boy\nIn Tsukimonogati Episode 1, while Tsukihi is washing and playing in Koyomi's hair, she uses the foam of the soap to create a quick hairstyle to Koyomi, making his hair resembles of the famous Astro Boy's haircut.\n\n \t \t \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t \n \t \t<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/2/22/Astro_boy.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170917014136\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Astro boy\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/2/22/Astro_boy.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20170917014136\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Astro boy.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Astro_boy.jpg\" data-relevant=\"1\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/2/22/Astro_boy.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20170917014136\" /></a> \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t \nBlack Jack[]\nIn the second season of Owarimonogatari, Mayoi Hell, when Araragi does the typical wordplay with Hachikuji, his face takes on the form of the sutured face of Kuroo Hazama, the infamous unlicensed doctor of Osamu Tezuka's Black Jack manga.\n\n \t \t<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/d/d0/Araragi_Black_jack.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905233155\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Araragi Black jack\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/d/d0/Araragi_Black_jack.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/480?cb=20170905233155\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Araragi Black jack.png\" data-image-key=\"Araragi_Black_jack.png\" data-relevant=\"1\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/d/d0/Araragi_Black_jack.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/480?cb=20170905233155\" /></a> \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t \n \t \t<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/9/9b/Black_jack_OVA_1993.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905233536\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Black jack OVA 1993\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/9/9b/Black_jack_OVA_1993.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/480?cb=20170905233536\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Black jack OVA 1993.png\" data-image-key=\"Black_jack_OVA_1993.png\" data-relevant=\"1\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/9/9b/Black_jack_OVA_1993.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/480?cb=20170905233536\" /></a> \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t \nFullmetal Alchemist[]\nIn Bakemonogatari Episode 1, after Hitagi pokes Koyomi's eyes, he asks her what kind of equivalent exchange prompted that. Senjougahara replies \"Copper: 40 grams, zinc: 25 grams, nickel: 15 grams, hiding my embarrassment: 5 grams, plus spite: 97 kilograms. These are the ingredients that make up my verbal abuse.\" This is a direct reference to both Fullmetal Alchemist's use of the law of equivalent exchange, as well as a discussion on the composition of a human body from the first arc of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga and repeated in episodes of both the original anime series and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. In Nisemonogatari Episode 3, some doodles of various Fullmetal Alchemist characters, including Roy Mustang, Edward Elric, and Alphonse Elric can be seen in Hitagi's textbook. The implication here is that Hitagi is a fan of the franchise.\n\nMedaka Box[]\nIn Owarimonogatari Episode 09, while Ononoki puts her foot mark on Araragi's face, she says: \"(...)'Jinsei wa saigo ni wa Purasu, Mainasu, Zero ni naru' datte... Hah! Sore wa shindara zero ni naru no wa atari maeda tsuno!\" Which means: \"(...)'The life boils down to Pluses, Minuses and Zeroes'... Hah! All that's left in the end is definitely the Zero!\".\n\n \t  \t \t \t\t\t   \t \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\tPluses, Minuses and Zeroes - Ononoki-chan's version \t\t \t\t \t \nThis is a reference to the famous line of Misogi Kumagawa from Medaka Box: \"(...)'Jinsei wa Purasu, Mainasu, Zero' datte iu yatsu wa... kimatte Purasu no yatsu nanda.\" Which means: \"The one who said 'The life boils down to Pluses, Minuses and Zeroes' must have been a Plus.\" \n\n \t  \t \t \t\t\t   \t \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\tPluses, Minuses and Zeroes-0 \t\t \t\t \t \nPlus, Minus and Zero are the classifications given to the kind of characters' mentality. It's worth noting that Medaka Box is also written by Nisio Isin, meaning he's referencing his own work.\n\nNeon Genesis Evangelion[]\nIn Nisemonogatari Episode 01, while Araragi is held captive by Senjougahara, she tells him:\n\"You won't die. Because I will protect you.\"\n To which he responds:\n\"I'd prefer this conversation without random Eva references.\"\n\n \t  \t \t \t\t\t   \t \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNisemonogatari - Evangelion Reference \t\t \t\t \t \nThis is referring to a scene in Neon Genesis Evangelion where main character Shinji expresses concern to his female partner Rei that they might die in an approaching mission while getting dressed. Rei responds, stating the same exact lines as Senjougahara.\nShingeki no Kyojin\nIn Koyomimonogatari Episode 02, when talking about having a fence on the rooftop of the the school, imagery of Araragi mimicking the famous pose of the Colossal Titan from Attack on Titan peaking over a large wall appears on screen. \n\n \t \t<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/6/66/Attack_on_araragi.png/revision/latest?cb=20161028014223\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Attack on araragi\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/6/66/Attack_on_araragi.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/414?cb=20161028014223\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"414\" height=\"230\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Attack on araragi.png\" data-image-key=\"Attack_on_araragi.png\" data-relevant=\"1\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/6/66/Attack_on_araragi.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/414?cb=20161028014223\" /></a> \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t \n \t \t<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/2/2c/Attack-on-titan.png/revision/latest?cb=20161028014512\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Attack-on-titan\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/2/2c/Attack-on-titan.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/413?cb=20161028014512\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"413\" height=\"234\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Attack-on-titan.png\" data-image-key=\"Attack-on-titan.png\" data-relevant=\"1\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/2/2c/Attack-on-titan.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/413?cb=20161028014512\" /></a> \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t \n\n\nSailor Moon[]\nIn the Tsukimonogatari anime Yotsugi Ononoki reenacts the iconic pose by Usagi Tsukino, the titular character of the series.\n\nHigurashi When They Cry[]\nIn Tsukimonogatari Yozuru Kagenui says to get on with the Resolution Arc and unravel the mystery which alludes to the Higurashi visual novel. The story structure of the VN is divided into Question and Resolution arcs. This fits in the Monogatari series due to its arc-based storytelling and use of mystery elements throughout.\n\nReferences to Japanese Literature[]\nNo Longer Human by Osamu Dazai[]\nIn Nisemonogatari Episode 09, a few frames of Koyomi were changed into the famed author Osamu Dazai. His depressed pose depicted in the anime shows his stress when he was writing the novel.\n\n\nReferences to Western Film[]\n2001: A Space Odyssey[]\nIn Kizumonogatari Part 2: Nekketsu, as Tsubasa Hanekawa lifts her skirt to show Ararargi her panties, imagery referencing the opening to 2001: A Space Odyssey is shown, complete with the original music. \n\n \t \t<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/c/c4/2001.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161223201828\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"2001\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/c/c4/2001.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/469?cb=20161223201828\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"469\" height=\"200\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"2001.jpg\" data-image-key=\"2001.jpg\" data-relevant=\"0\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/c/c4/2001.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/469?cb=20161223201828\" /></a> \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t \n \t \t<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/d/d9/2001_hanekawa.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161223201921\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"2001 hanekawa\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/d/d9/2001_hanekawa.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/470?cb=20161223201921\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"470\" height=\"200\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"2001 hanekawa.jpg\" data-image-key=\"2001_hanekawa.jpg\" data-relevant=\"0\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bakemonogatari1645/images/d/d9/2001_hanekawa.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/470?cb=20161223201921\" /></a> \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t \n \t  \t \t \t\t\t   \t \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t2001 A Space Odyssey Opening in 1080 HD \t\t \t\t \t \nJames Bond[]\nIn Owarimonogatari Episode 04, the episode opens with a monologue from Araragi describing himself as a young middle schooler.

As he explains this through monologue, he exclaims \"Freedom!\" while imagery of him facing a rainstorm appears onscreen.
