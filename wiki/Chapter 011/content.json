For that reason, Hitagi Senjougahara takes the bicycle of Koyomi Araragi and goes see Meme Oshino to rely on for help.\nAraragi buys an ice-cream to Mayoi in order to know a little bit more about the story between her and her mother. She tells him about the divorce and the fact that her mother's place is the place that she always wanted to visit whenever she has the chance but she can never find her way there.\nAraragi understands the feeling and pats her head but Mayoi surprisingly bites his hand in defense and so he beats her back by an uppercut in her stomach. Unfortunately, Tsubasa Hanekawa arrives just after this altercation where Mayoi is still on the ground."
