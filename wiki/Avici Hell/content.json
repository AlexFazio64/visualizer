    "text": "The reason why Araragi went to Hell is because he saved a vampire, Kiss-shot, back in spring break, which is considered one of the worst crimes.\nHachikuji is also in Hell because dying before her parents is considered a crime punishable in Hell.\nThe sentence for her crime is very light, so she resides in the uppermost level of Hell.\nShe came down to Avici in order to escort Araragi, because she knew he would end up here."
