    "text": "In the morning, Koyomi Araragi felt heavy and feverish, and has probably gotten only a few hours of sleep. Out of curiosity, he tried weighing himself on the bathroom scale, only to realize the fickleness of a god's mind.\nAfter arguing about the difference between the word \"captivated\" (蕩) and \"moe\" (萌), Hitagi Senjougahara tells Araragi that he will have a lover if he asks for it. Araragi refuses and starts to explain the reason why he doesn't want to return home today although it's Mother's Day. After that, he notices Mayoi Hachikuji and asks her if she's lost but she responds: \"I hate you\"."
