  "Description": "sugar sweet nightmare is the fifth opening theme of the Bakemonogatari anime. It was performed by Yui Horie, who voices Tsubasa Hanekawa. Although originally planned for the TV broadcast, it could only be featured on the home media release of Tsubasa Cat: Part 1, Part 3, Part 4 & Part 5.",
  "#Opening_Credits": {
    "link": [],
    "text": "The opening credits used to accompany the song reflects Tsubasa's wish to \"go on a trip when she graduates\" and, unlike the other theme songs used in the anime series, features a live-action version of Tsubasa posing in a number of locations that resemble that of key settings in the series. Throughout the credits, names of countries are shown in a split second (United Arab Emirates, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Argentina, Romania, and Portugal), mixed within the live action actress' appearances.\nAt the chorus, a particular road map is drawn over parts of the female anatomy, particularly the hands, feet and torso, followed with still shots of a woman's lower torso.\nThroughout the credits, the triangular pyramid is a consistent theme, and is often used to depict Tsubasa's \"cat ears\", which manifest when she transforms into Black Hanekawa."
