    "text": "Zoku Owarimonogatari has marked the longest time gap between anime adaptation releases since Nisemonogatari. The finale of Bakemonogatari to the premiere of Nisemonogatari was about 18 months. The finale of Owarimonogatari to the premiere of Zoku Owarimonogatari was about 15 months. Most other gaps have been within less than a year.\nThis marks the first adaptation directed by Akiyuki Shinbo alone. Tomoyuki Itamura had already left Shaft as he was credited as a storyboard artist on the 2018 anime film I Want to Eat Your Pancreas[6]."
