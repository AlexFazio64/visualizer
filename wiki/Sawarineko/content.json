  "Description": "The sawarineko (障り猫, lit., \"hindering cat\" or \"harming cat\") is an oddity that is known for their ability to drain the energy of its victims and suppress the abilities of other oddities. Although considered to be a relatively harmless entity compared to others, they can pose a greater threat at the right circumstances.\nThe only noted case of a sawarineko is that which came into contact with Tsubasa Hanekawa, which created her \"alternate identity\" Black Hanekawa. This particular sawarineko was described as being previously male before merging with Tsubasa; in which its gender was rendered vague through the resulting inception of the apparition, Black Hanekawa.",

    "text": "A sawarineko assumes the appearance of a domesticated cat with a pure silvery-white coat; one distinct trait that a sawarineko has is the absence of tail, although most people still fail to make a distinction despite this."
