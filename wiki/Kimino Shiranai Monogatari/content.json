    "text": "Ryo of Supercell was the one who composed the song's lyrics and arrangement of the track. [1] Originally, vocaloid Hatsune Miku was chosen as the vocalist for the closing theme as part of Supercell's self-titled debut album in March 2009. [2] Instead, Nagi Yanagi took over her place making their first release to not use a singing synthesizer.\nYanagi was chosen as the vocalist due to Ryo being a fan of her voice before uploading his songs to Nico Nico Douga in late 2007. Ryo's first song, \"Melt\", was covered by Yanagi roughly one day after the song's release on the platform. She herself was also a fan of Ryo's music and contacted him in collaborating songs together in the future.[3]"
