    "text": "Hanekawa seems to be on her way back from the library and passes by the park because she lives around. She then asks who is the little girl next to Koyomi and like a puppet he moves the jaws of Mayoi, who is still unconscious, to introduce her to Hanekawa. \nWhen regaining consciousness and even though she tells Hanekawa that she hates her, Hanekawa gives a hug to Mayoi because she really likes kids. But in the end, she slaps Mayoi because the little girl bites Koyomi out of no nowhere and Hanekawa forces her to apologize for this to Koyomi. Hanekawa yells at Koyomi too because he shouldn't be that violent. \nWhen leaving the two new comrades, Hanekawa says to Koyomi that it's tough for her to stay at home too. Koyomi says in sort of a flashback that she also was carrying \"the inharmony with her surrounding\" revealing that she was possessed by a cat. They somehow managed to resolve the oddity but not the origin of the \"strain\"."
