    "text": "The opening sequence for the Hanamonogatari anime series shows an alternate retelling of the development of the relationship between Suruga Kanbaru and Rouka Numachi. In this retelling, Suruga and Rouka are shown as friends turned into lovers when Rouka confessed her feelings for Suruga through a kiss, but their relationship immediately broke down after Rouka was injured. Suruga eventually confronts Rouka in a one-on-one basketball match. The sequence shares the same lily motif as in Ambivalent World."
