  "Description": "Tropicalesque Home-A-Wave Dog-Strings (トロピカレスク・ホームアヴェイヴ・ドッグストリングス, Toropikaresuku Hoomuaueivu Doggusutoringusu) was a vampire servant of Deathtopia Virtuoso Suicide-Master. \nAs a loyal servant, he followed orders from his master without hesitation, though during her affiliations with the Princess Beauty, Acerola, grew less and less tolerant of her. \nHe killed himself while attempting to kill Acerola, tearing his body apart past the point of regeneration.",
