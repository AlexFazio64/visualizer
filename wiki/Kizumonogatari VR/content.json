  "Description": "Kizumonogatari VR is a virtual reality experience for PlayStation VR based on the Kizumonogatari anime film trilogy. \nCreated in celebration of the trilogy's completion, it immerses the player into the world of the films using virtual reality and projection mapping as the player looks back at the films with the 10 year old form of Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade. [1] It launched on the Japanese Playstation Store on July 12th 2017 for free along side the blu-ray release of Kizumonogatari Part 3: Reiketsu. \nThe actual scenes depicted in the experience are entirely from Kizumonogatari Part 2: Nekketsu, and feature edited versions of each fight with the vampire hunters.",
