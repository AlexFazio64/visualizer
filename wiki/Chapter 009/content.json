Unfortunately, it seems Tsubasa Hanekawa sees throw him. After that, Araragi sums up briefly the two-week spring break where he became a vampire, how it was hell being attacking by a group who is trying to kill him, and how he met Meme Oshino. This incident remembers him of the real reason for the encounter with oddities.\nFlashback ends and after many attempts to know why Mayoi would like to go at the address on the paper, he finally gives her some money to have the answer. A person named Tsunade lives here and she is a relative of her."
