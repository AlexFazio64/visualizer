    "text": "Before Tsunade was married to her husband, they had a genuine love for each other. When they finally tied the knot they were no longer the same couple back then. Their relationship was unfortunately short-lived. Mayoi never actually saw them getting along for once, resulting a divorce 10 years ago.[1]\nShe and her husband stayed under the same roof for one more year after the separation. Tsunade was half-forced to agree on a vow made by her husband to never see her daughter again. In turn, her daughter was also vowed to never see her mother again in her father’s name.[1]"

It is later revealed that she was hit by a car while crossing a road, and had become an apparition. Koyomi and Hitagi Senjougahara then lead her to the site of where her mother used to live, and she finds peace."
