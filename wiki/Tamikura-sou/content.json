    "text": "Tamikura-sou was described by Hitagi as a lavish residence. However, it is revealed that Hitagi's own unit has newspaper pages for walls and is completely modest, almost impoverished, in appearance. The entire apartment complex is two-stories high and was built 30 years ago.[1]\nEach of its rooms are roughly more than 100 square feet with a small sink. It also features a shower and a toilet. A communal mailbox is available in front of the apartment. The rent here costs at an estimate thirty to forty thousand yen per month. This includes maintenance fees, neighborhood dues, and utilities.[1]"
